setFinal achieved a global reach of close to 1.5 billion viewers, with the opening match capturing over 550 millionAlmost six billion engagements on social media, with 262 billion cumulative reach across all platformsOne month since an unforgettable Final, we take a deep dive into the best ever FIFA World Cup and the sheer scale of organising the biggest single sporting event on the planetOn 18 December 2022, 88,966 spectators packed into Lusail Stadium and close to 1.5 billion around the world watched a pulsating Final between Argentina and France. One month to the day since Lionel Messi, Lionel Scaloni and La Albiceleste lifted the trophy, we review some facts and figures from on and off the pitch, that reflect the sheer scale of the biggest single sporting event on the planet.Early figures suggest that around 5 billion people have engaged with the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â\\x84¢, following tournament content across an array of platforms and devices across the media universe. On social media, according to Nielsen, there have been 93.6 million posts across all platforms, with a 262 billion cumulative reach and 5.95 billion engagements.The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â\\x84¢ was enjoyed inside the stadiums by 3.4 million spectators - up from 3 million in 2018 - who were treated to a historic tournament. 172 goals ensured that Qatar 2022 became the highest scoring FIFA World Cup in history, eclipsing the previous highest total of 171, in both 1998 and 2014.Three matches at Lusail Stadium, including the Final, saw the highest attendance for a match registered at a FIFA World Cup since USA 1994 when Brazil played Italy in front of 94,194 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.It was a tournament too of notable contributions from some of footballâ\\x80\\x99s heavyweights. Cristiano Ronaldo became the first man to score at five FIFA World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022) while Lionel Messi became the first player to score in four successive knockout stage matches in a FIFA World Cup since the round of 16 was introduced into the modern era, at Mexico â\\x80\\x9886. Messi also passed another landmark when he made his 26th FIFA World Cup appearance in the final, overtaking the record previously held by Lothar MatthÃ¤us.The fastest goal came after just 68 seconds when Canada's Alphonso Davies, 22, scored against Croatia. At just 18 years and 110 days, Spainâ\\x80\\x99s Gavi became the youngest goal scorer at a World Cup since PelÃ© in 1958, with a stunning strike during the 7-0 win against Costa Rica.\", 'In between 64 matches and 29 days of dramatic action on the field, millions of football fans enjoyed a spectacular display of cultural and entertainment activities at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â\\x84¢.In between 64 matches and 29 days of dramatic action on the field, millions of football fans enjoyed a spectacular display of cultural and entertainment activities at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â\\x84¢.As part of the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) Cultural Activation Programme, 16,190 performers from around the world contributed to Qatarâ\\x80\\x99s country-wide festival at key locations, including stadium precincts, the Corniche, FIFA Fan Festivalâ\\x84¢, Al Messila Bus Mall, Brahat Al Janoub and Madinatna fan accommodations, as well as the grand finale on Qatar National Day with artists concluding their journey by being part of the parade at Lusail Boulevard.As part of the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) Cultural Activation Programme, 16,190 performers from around the world contributed to Qatarâ\\x80\\x99s country-wide festival at key locations, including stadium precincts, the Corniche, FIFA Fan Festivalâ\\x84¢, Al Messila Bus Mall, Brahat Al Janoub and Madinatna fan accommodations, as well as the grand finale on Qatar National Day with artists concluding their journey by being part of the parade at Lusail Boulevard.â\\x80\\x9cThese performers played a huge part in the success of the World Cup.

Qatarâ\\x80\\x99s hosting of the World Cup is an opportunity for open dialogue and cultural exchange and it makes us proud to have showcased our local culture with millions from around the world,â\\x80\\x9d said Al Mohannadi.', 'As fans celebrated and cheered for their favourite players on the pitch during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â\\x84¢, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) honoured and protected heroes off the pitch â\\x80\\x93 hundreds of thousands of workers â\\x80\\x93 all of whom played an instrumental role in the delivery and success of the tournament.The cornerstone of these efforts were Workersâ\\x80\\x99 Welfare Standards (WWS), developed by the SC to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of workers. The SC continued to steer the implementation of the WWS to the wider tournament-centric sectors, to protect around 200,000 workers. The ground-breaking recruitment fees reimbursement programme, also continued to grow programme-wide. By the end of 2022, 266 contractors reimbursed QAR 86.6 M to more than 49,000 SC and non-SC workers who were charged illegal recruitment fees. In addition, three hotel operators and service providers also reimbursed QAR 163,670 to 58 workers. Following the success of the SCâ\\x80\\x99s Workersâ\\x80\\x99 Welfare Forums in the construction sector, these forums were extended to 70 hotels, in continued efforts to give workers a voice. These forums have empowered workers to share grievances through elected representatives, without fear of retaliation.The SC also focused on enhancing the bespoke StayQool cooling suits for workers, which were specifically designed to combat heat stress. By 2022, over 52,000 suits were deployed, in addition to 5,000 vests to security guards and 13,000 balaclavas to workers exposed to dust or sun. The StayQool suits were piloted in non-construction sectors to explore its wider use for outdoor professions.The SCâ\\x80\\x99s continued progress in building the workersâ\\x80\\x99 welfare legacy took centre stage at various high-profile events that were held during the year, including the panel discussions at the Concordia Annual Summit, World Innovation Summit for Health (WISH) 2022 and the UN General Assemblyâ\\x80\\x99s International Migration Review Forum, as well as webinars conducted by the Centre for Sport and Human Rights (CSHR) that focused on human rights and best practices in the hospitality and security sectors.Test events held during the year, such as the FIFA World Cupâ\\x84¢ Intercontinental Play-offs, the Lusail Super Cupâ\\x84¢ and the Bollywood Music Festival, helped to inform and augment the workersâ\\x80\\x99 welfare approach for the FIFA World Cup 2022â\\x84¢ and to cement tournament-readiness. As the FIFA World Cupâ\\x84¢ kicked off, WWDâ\\x80\\x99s team of inspectors met and interviewed more than 8,000 workers across stadiums, training sites and non-competition venues over the course of the tournament, to ensure that workersâ\\x80\\x99 rights were protected. Where issues were identified, follow-ups with contractors and government authorities were conducted to ensure that appropriate actions were taken. The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â\\x84¢ was testament to how the SC catalysed the transformative power of sports to deliver lasting social change. This was the first FIFA World Cupâ\\x84¢ to have a dedicated workersâ\\x80\\x99 welfare and labour rights team to protect workersâ\\x80\\x99 rights. This was an unprecedented achievement on a FIFA World Cupâ\\x84¢ programme, which has never before seen such emphasis being placed on human rights. While the tournament has concluded, the SCâ\\x80\\x99s focus on workersâ\\x80\\x99 welfare continues uninterrupted. Its commitment to collaboration and knowledge transfer will ensure that the pioneering work undertaken over the past decade continues to inform and strengthen Qatarâ\\x80\\x99s labour reforms to protect migrant workers.

The visionQataris Al Baker, Al Kuwari and Al Ibrahim were excited to develop the launch video for the mascot when they received the initial concept about his character.â\\x80\\x9cIt was very exciting to be involved in this project and our objective was to deliver something different to every previous mascot launch,â\\x80\\x9d said Al Baker, who has been working as a director and producer for 12 years. â\\x80\\x9cOne of our main aims was to present him in a humourous and interactive way while ensuring he appeals to as many people as possible â\\x80\\x93 not just football fans.â\\x80\\x9dAl Kuwari added: â\\x80\\x9cI am not a huge football lover and during the animation process, I looked at Laâ\\x80\\x99eeb from an outsiderâ\\x80\\x99s point of view. Part of the challenge was creating content that non-football fans would enjoy â\\x80\\x93 and I think Laâ\\x80\\x99eeb ended up being liked by everyone due to his uplifting personality.â\\x80\\x9dWriter and director Al Ibrahim worked as a senior content developer on the animation. He said: â\\x80\\x9cI helped to build on his backstory â\\x80\\x93 not only his origins but information about his home, the mascot-verse.

In the end, we opted for English â\\x80\\x93 but spoken by a local person â\\x80\\x93 to show Laâ\\x80\\x99eeb is Qatari and can connect with people anywhere,â\\x80\\x9d said Al Baker.Al Kuwari added: â\\x80\\x9cAs content creators, it is our responsibility to create narratives true to our culture and heritage, and present them to international audiences.â\\x80\\x9dNew technologyLaâ\\x80\\x99eebâ\\x80\\x99s virtual nature meant the creative options were endless and opened the door to utilise the latest digital technology. â\\x80\\x9cFrom holograms, digital screens and new media, there was plenty of room for creativity and we were able to experiment with different technologies,â\\x80\\x9d said Al Baker. Al Kuwari added: â\\x80\\x9cOur priority was for Laâ\\x80\\x99eeb to entertain fans. We wanted to create uplifting and interactive content, so we approached this in the same way we look at cinematic scripts.

My dad â\\x80\\x93 Ali Al Nuaimi â\\x80\\x93 was an ambassador and a big football fan. My uncle was one of the founding members of Qatar Sports Club. The moment people see my name, they automatically know Iâ\\x80\\x99m a Qatar Sports Club fan. Where did you go to university and what were your aspirations growing up?I studied English language and literature at Qatar University. I also did my Masters there. Growing up, I was inspired by my dad, so international relations and languages interested me. However, technology was my main interest. Itâ\\x80\\x99s everywhere and you can see how itâ\\x80\\x99s improving peopleâ\\x80\\x99s lives.One event that inspired me when I was younger was the Asian Games in Doha. I attended the opening and followed all the news about it. I was too young to be part of the workforce but I wished I was involved. I felt it was a missed opportunity â\\x80\\x93 I wish I had volunteered or done something to support it. However, it inspired me to volunteer for future sporting events. I met people through volunteering at sporting events who I now work with at the SC. Like everyone, I never thought the World Cup would be hosted here â\\x80\\x93 so it feels like we have been given a golden opportunity to work on something even bigger than the Asian Games.Tell us about your career. I started my career with ICT Qatar in 2007. At the time, Qatar was booming and a lot of entities were being established as the country was looking to move away from oil and gas. I started with the information security team, specifically communications and outreach. At this time, technology was being adapted for different sectors, like health and education. Our work helped to open up the market and establish a whole new ecosystem. Later I worked in the ICT and society department.One person who inspired me was Her Excellency Hessa Al Jaber, the former Minister for Information Communications & Technology. She made sure we â\\x80\\x93 as fresh graduates â\\x80\\x93 were involved in everything. If there was a board meeting or strategy session, she would have young people there to see how decisions are made. She wanted us to understand every part of the business. She helped us all to understand the bigger picture.\\xa0 Where were you when Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup and how did you feel?We had a family gathering and were all watching TV. I cried after the announcement. I had feelings of pride and happiness. I was also thinking of my dad, who had passed away earlier that year. I wished I could tell my dad we had won the bid.Winning was a dream. I knew it was something big. Even if we didnâ\\x80\\x99t win, the fact we put ourselves out there, it was still an achievement. But winning was amazing. It was unimaginable for so many people. How keen were you to be involved in the delivery of the tournament?Very keen. I remember at that time, Qatar was also bidding to host the 2020 Olympics and there was a competition run by the bid committee to design a website for Doha 2020. You had to come up with ideas, functionality, innovation. My friend and I partnered up and we managed to win. There were more than 2,000 applications from across the region and the final was at Katara, with Sheikha Al Mayassa on the jury. That gave us both a bit of profile. We won QAR 100,000 and got to engage with the bid team. Qatar didnâ\\x80\\x99t win the bid in the end but that experience was so valuable. After we won, a colleague at the SC called me and asked me to come for an interview for the Legacy department. Tell us about your career with the SC.I was involved in social and human legacy projects when I joined. I worked on the Josoor Institute project and was involved in setting it up. I helped to develop the Challenge 22 innovation competition â\\x80\\x93 which was similar to the competition I won with my friend. There, I had been on the receiver side, so I knew how we could work with businesses to build the project. I was also involved in strategy before moving to Communications. Now, I have a much wider scope: digital, content, media relations, community engagement, ambassadors and much more. Working in legacy â\\x80\\x93 from the stage where our ideas were only on paper â\\x80\\x93 has helped me a lot in my current role. Knowing the strategy makes the projects easier to communicate about. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s been the great bridge between my roles at the SC. What are your favourite memories of your time at the SC?There are so many â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to pick one. A few days ago, we had a meeting with the whole team and it was wonderful to see everyone all ready for the tournament. When I look back over the last 10 years, no matter how beautiful our stadiums are or the other facilities, it all comes down to people. And seeing everyone there â\\x80\\x93 like-minded and with the same spirit â\\x80\\x93 I could see we are heading in the right direction. It was a proud moment and emotional because it is the final chapter. I could see everyone is unified. Everyone at the SC is like a second family to me. I always try to have close connections to my team. How will you feel when the opening match kicks off at Al Bayt Stadium?I will feel itâ\\x80\\x99s real â\\x80\\x93 and at that moment Iâ\\x80\\x99ll try and catch my breath. Right now, weâ\\x80\\x99re just waiting for the fans to come and enjoy themselves. Everything is ready â\\x80\\x93 and when the tournament finally kicks off, I will be emotional. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure I will be proud too.And what about the final at Lusail Stadium â\\x80\\x93 how will you feel when the trophy is lifted on 18 December?Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be filled with pride but at the same time I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be able to believe itâ\\x80\\x99s the end. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been working on the same project for the last 10 years and there will be mixed emotions. Delivering a World Cup is not a normal business. Itâ\\x80\\x99s 24/7, itâ\\x80\\x99s demanding, thereâ\\x80\\x99s pressure. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure how Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go back to a quiet life.Whatâ\\x80\\x99s next for you â\\x80\\x93 in 2023 and beyond?I think Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have a holiday first and then focus on telling the story of Qatar 2022. As a communications team, we will have a lot of work to do. We need to look at the sustainability of the event, the economic impact and narrate the story of how the World Cup will boost Qatar long into the future. There will still be plenty of work for us to do next year. For me, I love to be involved in transformational projects. Qatar has changed so much in recent years. So many things have opened. People will see the fan experience and entertainment options during the World Cup, and these things will continue to enhance the community and quality of life in Qatar. Itâ\\x80\\x99s crucial we keep working hard to develop our country.

The revolutionary system was first showcased during the inauguration of Khalifa International Stadium in 2017 and since then has been adapted to benefit six more tournament venues, as well as other facilities across the country.With Qatarâ\\x80\\x99s World Cup taking place in November and December, the pressure on cooling systems will be limited, with outside temperatures estimated to be 18-24Â°C. The technology will, however, allow sporting events to be held all-year-round, in addition to other activities, like shopping and farming.Energy-efficient cooling systems were developed following Qatarâ\\x80\\x99s successful bid for the World Cup, with the technology delivered by the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy in collaboration with Qatar University (QU).

Each of the other venueâ\\x80\\x99s cooling technology is different and made to fit its unique design and features. Using solar-powered energy, outside air is cooled and then distributed through grills in the stands and large pitch-side nozzles.

', 'With only weeks to go until Qatar hosts the first FIFA World Cupâ\\x84¢ in the Middle East and Arab world, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), in close collaboration with FIFA, is wrapping up preparations for the tournament and the legacy it will deliver.In this new series, we are focusing on the work of Qatari employees who have played a key role in the SCâ\\x80\\x99s journey. This week, we speak to Thani Al Zarraa, who joined the SC in 2012 and has worked on a range of projects over the last decade, including stadium developments, legacy programmes and transport management. What were you doing when Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup?I fondly remember it. It was 2 December 2010. At that time, I was a graduate student impatiently waiting for graduation day in Australia. My friends and colleagues from Gulf countries got together to watch the announcement. We were all wearing bid T-shirts to show our support. Australia was also part of the bid, so when we heard the news, we were ecstatic! We went out into the streets to celebrate. Were you a football fan growing up?Tell us about your journey working at the SC.Back in 2012, we only had plans on paper and feasibility studies, which werenâ\\x80\\x99t even complete. Back then, I was with the legacy department and we used to create legacy benefit case studies to explore the potential use of World Cup venues after the tournament. We used to conduct focus groups with local communities to ask them how they could benefit from World Cup facilities and to find out any concerns they had. Later, I moved into construction and eventually became Al Janoub Stadium Project Director.How has working at the SC impacted your career?Itâ\\x80\\x99s been incredibly valuable. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had the opportunity to take part in international events on secondment and observation programmes. These offered great insight into venue management and how mega-events are organised. I attended the UEFA Champions League final in 2017 between Juventus and Real Madrid and was with the project team in charge of dressing and signage, making sure all the overlay was ready. During the 2019 Copa America, I was an assistant venue manager in Rio. We were responsible for the Estadio do MaracanÃ£, two team hotels and two training sites.\\xa0I am so grateful for all these experiences and much more over the last 10 years. They have given me the ability so build technical expertise and reach my current role working in transport. Tell us about your current role and how it is supporting the tournament.I work in transport management. I believe that transport, after the venues, is the main artery of any mega-event. As part of my role, I ensure that different transportation projects in the country are being delivered to a high standard â\\x80\\x93 as part of our bid commitments to FIFA. We are making sure the different transport options, whether bus, metro, tram or taxi, work efficiently for our different constituent groups, including fans and players. We consider the whole experience â\\x80\\x93 from the moment people arrive at the airport to the moment they depart. We work closely with a range of stakeholders to make sure our plans are streamlined and communicated effectively. Another key aspect of our operations during the tournament will be the command centre, where we will gather all transport elements under one umbrella and review their operations continuously during the tournament. What do you hope fans experience, in terms of transportation services, during the World Cup?I think the compact nature of the tournament is a huge advantage â\\x80\\x93 but we are encouraging all fans and visitors to plan their journeys carefully. I think fans will be amazed how close everything is â\\x80\\x93 from their accommodation to stadiums to fan zones. We have worked very hard to cater for everyone and ensure their journeys are as smooth as possible. What does your typical day at the SC look like?\\xa0My favourite part of the day is early morning. I get up at 4:30 AM to exercise. Then I come to the office and itâ\\x80\\x99s usually very quiet, as you would expect at that time. I have a coffee and plan my agenda for the day. Iâ\\x80\\x99m usually in meetings or on calls throughout. There are always new challenges. No day is the same. What mark do you hope to leave in your experience working for the SC?Well, I think it works both ways, because Qatar has given us many opportunities. We are very lucky to be given the resources and facilities and then be given the chance to contribute to the success of the tournament and the country overall.\\xa0Which moment from your career at the SC is the most memorable?I was part of the inauguration of Khalifa International Stadium in 2017. Al Janoub Stadium was another big milestone for me. I was part of the venue management team at the inauguration and the project team during construction. Both stadiums are very close to my heart. I can actually spot both of them on a clear day from my office window.\\xa0These two moments, in May 2017 and May 2019, are very precious to me.What will you cherish most from this experience?Many things! The people that work here and the speed at which Qatar has delivered everything are admirable. The World Cup really has transformed our nation and placed it on the global stage. I am honoured to be part of this story. Who influenced you during your time at the SC?The late Hilal Al Kuwari is a personality I will never forget. I remember meeting Engineer Hilal before I worked at the SC when I wanted to conduct a feasibility study for my degree. I bumped into a consultant who was working on a major project for Qatar and they advised me to consult the project manager, who, at that time, was Engineer Hilal. Then I met him officially at the SC, when I worked with him in 2014. His energy and love for knowledge were incomparable and very infectious. He was keen on giving us the right knowledge and tools to succeed. I recall every time my colleagues and I would sit with him, we would want to make sure we were prepared with questions.\\xa0He had a bulk of knowledge and eagerness to share it. He is definitely someone that I learned from. It was a great pleasure getting to know him. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s on the horizon for you after the World Cup?Career-wise, I would love to keep working in the sports industry. Sport management is something I have become very passionate about, whether through my role with the SC or my hobby with the cycling federation.

Khaled holds a degree in petroleum engineering from Texas A&M University at Qatar and a Masterâ\\x80\\x99s degree in strategic business unit management from HEC Paris. Why did you join the SC? Joining the SC was an easy decision for me. Growing up, football shaped my childhood. All I ever did was play football in the neighbourhood with my friends. When the opportunity came to join this project, it felt right. This is the biggest sporting event in the world â\\x80\\x93 I had to be a part of it. I wanted to give back to my beloved country.

What do you remember about the day Qatar won the bid to host the FIFA World Cupâ\\x84¢?I remember I had just arrived in Houston, Texas, as part of my first work assignment abroad with ExxonMobil. I was surrounded by my Qatari friends when the announcement was made. I felt goosebumps knowing that Qatar will make its footprint everywhere when it hosts the biggest football event. It feels like it was just yesterday. Did you ever dream you would get the chance to work on this mega-event?At the time, I was mostly focused on engineering as a career. However, over the years, my interests changed and I switched career paths. Thankfully everything worked out. Tell us about your role at the SC and how youâ\\x80\\x99re helping to deliver the tournament.I am currently leading the Community Engagement division at the SC. Through my role, I oversee the SCâ\\x80\\x99s relationship with local stakeholders, as well as our community engagement efforts.

The Community Engagement division has had various accomplishments during each milestone which significantly enhanced the fan experience.It satisfies us to see fans enjoying the matches and activations, and this leaves us with a sense of accomplishment. The trophy tour that took place during Eid was a great example of our community engagement efforts, which created buzz and excitement ahead of the World Cup. The closest milestone to my heart is the inauguration of Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium, because it was the first match post-pandemic and it was great seeing all the fans come back together. It was also the first milestone I worked on after joining the SC, which makes it special.How would you describe the team dynamic at the SC? At the SC, weâ\\x80\\x99re truly a family. I am beyond lucky to have a team like mine. The team is energetic, positive, happy and passionate. No matter the pressure and challenges, the team is always ready to deliver amazing, and to the best of their abilities. What does a typical day at the SC look like? I donâ\\x80\\x99t think a typical day exists at the SC. Every day brings new surprises and challenges. I would say the typical day begins in the morning and ends the following morning. What are some challenges you encounter?\\xa0 I love challenges. They bring out an innovative side to all of us. The biggest challenge weâ\\x80\\x99re facing is time, or the lack of it.

Change is always future-oriented, and this is reflected by the very name of the course â\\x80\\x93 the third female edition of FLF. It is also symbolic, because it is aimed at a group that used to be shamefully under-represented in the football of the past â\\x80\\x93 but that will help shape the future of this sport and ensure that it has a good future.â\\x80\\x9d', 'Saudi Arabia legend Nawaf Al Temyat has taken part in six editions of the FIFA World Cupâ\\x84¢: three as a player, two as a TV analyst and one as an official with the Saudi Arabian Football Federation.

Our players will be very familiar with the stadiums and great weather. They will also have a lot of support.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x9cThe tournament will not be easy. Success in qualification and doing well at the World Cup are two very different things. Having 10 players who have already played in a World Cup will be a great boost for us but we will need to play at a higher pace to compete against other teams. At the end of the day, nothing is impossible, and I hope we can do something special at the World Cup in Qatar.â\\x80\\x9dAl Temyat, a former Asian player of the year, went on to speak of the unifying power of football and his excitement ahead of Qatar 2022.

Our first interview is with Maryam Hamad Al Muftah, Executive Director, ICT Event Operations. Maryam, from Al Wakrah, joined the SC in 2013 after studying computer engineering at Qatar University and graduating in 2007. She obtained a Masterâ\\x80\\x99s degree from HEC Paris before joining the SC from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). Why did you join the SC and why were you interested in working on this mega-project?It was an amazing opportunity to leave my comfort zone. I like event management and I enjoy working with people from different cultures and backgrounds. So, joining the SC was a unique opportunity â\\x80\\x93 and a World Cup in this region will only happen once for my generation. I felt there was no better way to use my skills and I knew the role would help me grow in so many ways.When you were growing up, did you ever think you would work on a World Cup?It never crossed my mind. I was a fresh graduate when Qatar won the bid and there was so much attention on the World Cup. Everyone in Qatar wanted to work on the project. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know if I would have the opportunity at first â\\x80\\x93 but as time went on, I was more and more eager to join the team and help to â\\x80\\x98Deliver Amazingâ\\x80\\x99.When the role at the SC became available I was planning to take a break from my job at QIA â\\x80\\x93 so the SCâ\\x80\\x99s timing was perfect. Back then I became the Manager of Infrastructure in the IT Department and never imagined I would be here now, in the thick of tournament preparations.What do you remember about the day Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup?It was such a special day for everyone in the country. I think everyone has their own story about it. I was at the Four Seasons hotel for a family wedding. We were all watching the TV anxiously waiting for the announcement. Afterwards, we were all ecstatic. How did you get interested in IT? Itâ\\x80\\x99s always been a passion of mine. I like the fact the IT field is generally a few steps ahead of other industries. It is technological and always trying to innovate. As soon as I graduated, I knew I needed to follow this passion.Tell us about your role at the SC and how youâ\\x80\\x99re helping to deliver the tournament.I currently manage the Information Communications Technology division and lead on all technological aspects of the tournament. When we first won the bid, Qatar announced it would deliver a smart World Cup, so technology became an important part of our infrastructure and crucial for planning a seamless tournament. Tell us about your team spirit and collaboration. One of my biggest accomplishments is the team dynamic. I am very proud of every one of them. My team is great â\\x80\\x93 weâ\\x80\\x99re like a family. We work together seamlessly with the goal of delivering a successful tournament. This tournament requires solid expertise and a team that can deliver under pressure. We have overcome multiple challenges together and are excited to take on new ones. When the pandemic first hit, my team was ready to work through it and we came out of this successfully. I am honoured to say we are ready to deliver a smart World Cup. Which project has been the most rewarding and why?During the FIFA Arab Cup, we managed a range of projects, including international connectivity, the implementation of mobile/tetra/radio devices in stadiums, and the optical transport network that carries event IT network and broadcast network traffic. We worked closely with the Communications Regulatory Authority in order to meet FIFA obligations and delivered a number of projects in a short timeframe, including the command centre and press conference area. The work we put in allowed broadcasters to take the highest quality footage in the quickest possible time â\\x80\\x93 which is one achievement we are truly proud of.What services will the IT department manage during the World Cup?We will build on the work we delivered during the FIFA Arab Cup. We will be managing networks and supporting radio and broadcast services. We will be specifically responsible for providing broadcast connectivity, which will help media to broadcast matches all around the world. We will also provide back-up solutions for broadcast connectivity, such as the satellite back-up. Our work makes me confident that fans here in Qatar and across the globe will experience the World Cup of a lifetime.What are some challenges you encounter in your role and what advice would you give to the next generation of IT professionals?Being a Qatari woman working in the sports sector can be challenging, however I have managed to overcome that. Another challenge is women working in the technology industry generally, as it tends to be male-dominated. However, I have found that nothing is difficult where there is teamwork. Whether youâ\\x80\\x99re new or experienced, teamwork determines everything. How do you think the World Cup will impact Qatar and the region?I think this is just the beginning for Qatar. The attention we have had means we will be more open to investors, tourists and jobseekers. I think the country will continue to evolve and look to build a greater degree of sustainability for future generations. I think this is just the beginning for Qatar. The attention we have had means we will be more open to investors, tourists and jobseekers. I think the country will continue to evolve and look to build a greater degree of sustainability for future generations. What will you cherish most from this experience and how will you feel when the trophy is lifted at Lusail Stadium on 18 December?I will cherish all the memories that I made here, and the deep bonds we created. We are truly a family at the SC. After the final, tears of joy, happiness and humbleness will flow. Witnessing what we made will definitely give me goosebumps. \\xa0What does the future hold for you beyond 2022? What are your ambitions?Iâ\\x80\\x99m very keen to continue my work in ICT. It is a broad field and constantly evolving â\\x80\\x93 and this is what motivates me for the future. I would like to continue working in a fast-paced field and remain at the forefront of technological advancements, while always seeking to acquire new skills.

During my time in Qatar, I find local people support football in general, so I see similar positive impacts taking place here, as it did back in Japan two decades ago. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0What advice would you give to Japan fans who are planning to travel to Qatar?Japanese fans should search online and learn about the cultural differences. My general advice is to do your research â\\x80\\x93 it is important to gather as much information as possible. What are the top places to visit in Qatar?I would say the first place to visit is Souq Waqif, which offers a very Middle Eastern experience. Apart from that, there are four or five beautiful museums. They are well located and easy to access, so I would definitely encourage people to visit them to understand more about the culture and art of the country and region.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s one of the best parts about working here.What are some challenges you encounter?\\xa0 Working around the clock is a daily challenge we face here at the SC. Dealing with ambassadors and working around their time zones and schedules is a challenge. For example, our Brazilian ambassadors, like Cafu, have completely different working hours to us. What does it mean to you to be a part of the SC?Being a part of this tournament means being a part of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s history. I will forever be proud of my role at the SC and contributing to the success of the World Cup. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think our generation will witness a similar mega-event in our lifetime, so it fills me with pride. Did you form any personal relationships with the ambassadors? Growing up, I have always loved video games and I would always play FIFA and choose the FIFA legends as players. I always looked up to them. So when the opportunity came to work in the programme, it was a dream come true. I now communicate with these legends, like Cafu, Samuel Etoâ\\x80\\x99o and Ronald de Boer, on a daily basis, and we have formed great friendships over the years. What kind of legacy do you want the World Cup to leave behind? I want future generations to benefit from this tournament.
