One month to the day since Lionel Messi, Lionel Scaloni and La Albiceleste lifted the trophy, we review some facts and figures from on and off the pitch, that reflect the sheer scale of the biggest single sporting event on the planet.Early figures suggest that around 5 billion people have engaged with the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢, following tournament content across an array of platforms and devices across the media universe. On social media, according to Nielsen, there have been 93.6 million posts across all platforms, with a 262 billion cumulative reach and 5.95 billion engagements.The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ was enjoyed inside the stadiums by 3.4 million spectators - up from 3 million in 2018 - who were treated to a historic tournament. 172 goals ensured that Qatar 2022 became the highest scoring FIFA World Cup in history, eclipsing the previous highest total of 171, in both 1998 and 2014.Three matches at Lusail Stadium, including the Final, saw the highest attendance for a match registered at a FIFA World Cup since USA 1994 when Brazil played Italy in front of 94,194 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.It was a tournament too of notable contributions from some of footballâs heavyweights. Cristiano Ronaldo became the first man to score at five FIFA World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022) while Lionel Messi became the first player to score in four successive knockout stage matches in a FIFA World Cup since the round of 16 was introduced into the modern era, at Mexico â86. Messi also passed another landmark when he made his 26th FIFA World Cup appearance in the final, overtaking the record previously held by Lothar MatthÃ¤us.The fastest goal came after just 68 seconds when Canada's Alphonso Davies, 22, scored against Croatia. At just 18 years and 110 days, Spainâs Gavi became the youngest goal scorer at a World Cup since PelÃ© in 1958, with a stunning strike during the 7-0 win against Costa Rica."

2,11 January 2023,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/sc-workers-welfare-standards-protected-more-than-200000-workers-during-qatar-2022,"As fans celebrated and cheered for their favourite players on the pitch during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) honoured and protected heroes off the pitch â hundreds of thousands of workers â all of whom played an instrumental role in the delivery and success of the tournament.The cornerstone of these efforts were Workersâ Welfare Standards (WWS), developed by the SC to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of workers. The SC continued to steer the implementation of the WWS to the wider tournament-centric sectors, to protect around 200,000 workers. The ground-breaking recruitment fees reimbursement programme, also continued to grow programme-wide. By the end of 2022, 266 contractors reimbursed QAR 86.6 M to more than 49,000 SC and non-SC workers who were charged illegal recruitment fees. In addition, three hotel operators and service providers also reimbursed QAR 163,670 to 58 workers. Following the success of the SCâs Workersâ Welfare Forums in the construction sector, these forums were extended to 70 hotels, in continued efforts to give workers a voice. These forums have empowered workers to share grievances through elected representatives, without fear of retaliation.The SC also focused on enhancing the bespoke StayQool cooling suits for workers, which were specifically designed to combat heat stress. By 2022, over 52,000 suits were deployed, in addition to 5,000 vests to security guards and 13,000 balaclavas to workers exposed to dust or sun. The StayQool suits were piloted in non-construction sectors to explore its wider use for outdoor professions.The SCâs continued progress in building the workersâ welfare legacy took centre stage at various high-profile events that were held during the year, including the panel discussions at the Concordia Annual Summit, World Innovation Summit for Health (WISH) 2022 and the UN General Assemblyâs International Migration Review Forum, as well as webinars conducted by the Centre for Sport and Human Rights (CSHR) that focused on human rights and best practices in the hospitality and security sectors.Test events held during the year, such as the FIFA World Cupâ¢ Intercontinental Play-offs, the Lusail Super Cupâ¢ and the Bollywood Music Festival, helped to inform and augment the workersâ welfare approach for the FIFA World Cup 2022â¢ and to cement tournament-readiness. As the FIFA World Cupâ¢ kicked off, WWDâs team of inspectors met and interviewed more than 8,000 workers across stadiums, training sites and non-competition venues over the course of the tournament, to ensure that workersâ rights were protected. Where issues were identified, follow-ups with contractors and government authorities were conducted to ensure that appropriate actions were taken. The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ was testament to how the SC catalysed the transformative power of sports to deliver lasting social change. This was the first FIFA World Cupâ¢ to have a dedicated workersâ welfare and labour rights team to protect workersâ rights. This was an unprecedented achievement on a FIFA World Cupâ¢ programme, which has never before seen such emphasis being placed on human rights. While the tournament has concluded, the SCâs focus on workersâ welfare continues uninterrupted. Its commitment to collaboration and knowledge transfer will ensure that the pioneering work undertaken over the past decade continues to inform and strengthen Qatarâs labour reforms to protect migrant workers.

3,5 January 2023,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/we-are-promoting-healthier-smarter-and-safer-societies,"For B4Development (B4D) â a Qatar 2022 legacy project launched by the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) â 2022 was an important year. It saw the Middle East and North Africa regionâs first behavioural insights and nudge unit partake in several activities during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢, thereby setting new standards in the way behavourial science can play a role in mega sporting events.B4D worked with different stakeholders to put in place a number of nudges â or design led prompts â to influence the behaviour of fans during the tournament. For example, B4D teamed up with the World Health Organization (WHO) and Qatarâs Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) to promote healthy food options at Qatar 2022 stadiums as well as the FIFA Fan Festivalâ¢. To achieve this, foods that were deemed as healthy options on the menu were made more attractive by highlighting them, as well as providing a picture of how they would look.B4D also supported with the design of tournament messaging to encourage greater use of public transportation, environmentally sustainable behaviors in stadiums, training of volunteers as well as applying early for the mandatory Hayya Card.The work B4D undertook throughout the year also extended beyond the FIFA World Cupâ¢. In May, B4D continued its work with the MoPH by conducting a nation-wide experiment that informed decision makers about the healthy living and eating habits of Qatarâs citizens and residents. A month later, in July, B4D participated in the Concordia Americas Summit 2022. During the global gathering, B4D discussed their work as part of the partnership between Generation Amazing and Concacaf. The initiative will see behavioural science used across 41 countries to behaviorally inform, monitoring and evaluate social policies. This will work to ensure that the legacy of Qatar 2022 impacts disenfranchised communities around the world.âThrough our partnerships in Qatar and around the world, we are promoting the use of behavioural science as a tool to build healthier, smarter and safer societies. This past year proved that nudge units like B4D have an important role to play in policymaking, and making a difference to peopleâs lives, and that is something that we will carry with us going into the future,â added Dr. Makki.Follow @roadto2022news on Twitter and Instagram to learn more about the legacy and social impact of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ on Qatar and the world."

But a series of injuries curtailed her football career at the age of just 22 â forcing her to rethink her career objectives. Carling has spent the last week in Qatar as part of the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacyâs Cultural Activation Programme during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢. She has produced murals at the Corniche and outside Al Bayt and Lusail stadiums, including during the final between Argentina and France. We caught up with Carling to discuss her work and inspiration, along with her dreams for the future. I call my work âportraits of immortalityâ. We canât play our sport forever â so I ask athletes to choose a moment when they felt invincible, when they felt like a gladiator on the pitch, and then I paint it. From 1912 to 1948, art was an Olympic sport, including poetry, sculpture and painting. It shows thereâs a close link between sport and art. When youâre on the field, youâre creating â and I try to bring that experience of playing to my artwork. Tell us about your Qatar 2022 experience.Tell us about the work youâve created in Qatar.I was asked to create pieces of footballers. I wanted to highlight iconic goals and moments. The first piece I did featured Richarlisonâs scissor-kick for Brazil against Serbia, which was one of the best goals of the tournament. The next piece I did featured Messi and Maradona at Lusail Stadium; then I painted Mbappe and Achraf Hakimi at Al Bayt. I wanted to paint Mbappe and Hakimi as they are friends â I wanted to show the respect and sportsmanship between them. I actually know Richarlison and Achraf, so I messaged them a photo of the murals I created. It was really cool. For the final, I painted Messi and Mbappe. I added the third star to the Argentina crest after they lifted the trophy. The response from fans after the match was amazing.Showcasing my work here is indescribable. My goal when I was younger was to make the World Cup as a player but that couldnât happen. Being the first sports artist to paint at a World Cup is amazing though. Itâs historic. Being among the fans and getting the feedback and interaction is awesome. Having everyone appreciate my art on a global scale is life-changing and so rewarding. Iâm really grateful for this opportunity.  Whatâs next for your career?"

You need to describe the distances on the pitch, the playersâ facial expressions, the number of people in a wall, what type of corner is taken. Itâs about trying to paint a picture in peopleâs minds by following the ball and providing as much detail as possible.â"

I produce techno, which can be both dark and energetic. The music reflects who I am as a person and my energy â both as Khalid and when I step on stage as DJ Deus Deserto.How and when did you start performing?I began to DJ in college, which was 2014. Since high school, it was my dream to own some decks and learn how to do it. So, before I started college, I worked for six months to save up and buy my own kit. I was ecstatic when I bought them and did a lot of experimenting. In fact, I only started doing this professionally about three years ago â thatâs when I started producing music. Then, in 2021, I released my first track.Music is my part-time job for now. I am proud to say that Iâve been successful in releasing my music with international labels and have been fortunate to land gigs in Qatar and the United States. I plan to push further and see where my art can take me.How has your World Cup experience been so far?Itâs been amazing, I am really impressed with the organisation and entertainment. The football itself has also been incredible to watch this year. The crowds are super supportive when Iâm performing. For me, the cultural performances have been the most fun to see. It helps that we are working with such energetic fans. I was also lucky to be able to perform in front of a huge crowd at MDL Beast here in Qatar and showcase my music to a diverse audience. It was an amazing experience and the production level was mind-blowing. Next, Iâll be taking my music to the spider stage at Arcadia. "

It is the first edition of the tournament to be held in the Middle East and Arab world, the first compact tournament in modern history and the first to have an official soundtrack.It is also the first FIFA World Cupâ¢ to have a digital mascot. Laâeeb â an Arabic word meaning super-skilled player â was unveiled to the world during the final draw in April. Laâeeb hails from the âmascot-verseâ â a world where all previous tournament mascots live â and is known for his youthful spirit; spreading joy and confidence wherever he goes. Laâeeb, who is adventurous, fun and curious, has attended every previous FIFA World Cup tournament and contributed to some of the most famous moments in football history.Here, we speak to Ahmed Al Baker, Fahad Al Kuwari and Mohammed Al Ibrahim, who worked on Laâeebâs launch video, to find out more about the challenge of creating content that appeals to football fans across the globe. The visionQataris Al Baker, Al Kuwari and Al Ibrahim were excited to develop the launch video for the mascot when they received the initial concept about his character.âIt was very exciting to be involved in this project and our objective was to deliver something different to every previous mascot launch,â said Al Baker, who has been working as a director and producer for 12 years. âOne of our main aims was to present him in a humourous and interactive way while ensuring he appeals to as many people as possible â not just football fans.âAl Kuwari added: âI am not a huge football lover and during the animation process, I looked at Laâeeb from an outsiderâs point of view. Part of the challenge was creating content that non-football fans would enjoy â and I think Laâeeb ended up being liked by everyone due to his uplifting personality.âWriter and director Al Ibrahim worked as a senior content developer on the animation. He said: âI helped to build on his backstory â not only his origins but information about his home, the mascot-verse. We had to think about his personality traits and motivations â it was a really interesting project.âThe creative team also wanted Laâeeb to resonate with people long after the tournament â which will conclude with the final at Lusail Stadium on 18 December. âItâs very important to us that Laâeeb stays in the minds of football fans after the World Cup,â said Al Kuwari, a graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar. âThis is one of the reasons we built the mascot-verse, which allows Laâeeb to visit mascots from previous tournaments.âA mascot with a voiceLaâeebâs uniqueness extends to his voice.âWhen we presented our work, FIFA really liked the scripts we had developed for Laâeeb,â said Al Kuwari, who holds a Masterâs in film and screen studies from Goldsmiths, University of London.The next challenge was deciding Laâeebâs accent and ensuring he would resonate with people in Qatar, the region and beyond.âAt first, we wanted Laâeeb to speak Arabic with a Qatari accent â however we also wanted him to reach international audiences. In the end, we opted for English â but spoken by a local person â to show Laâeeb is Qatari and can connect with people anywhere,â said Al Baker.Al Kuwari added: âAs content creators, it is our responsibility to create narratives true to our culture and heritage, and present them to international audiences.âNew technologyLaâeebâs virtual nature meant the creative options were endless and opened the door to utilise the latest digital technology. âFrom holograms, digital screens and new media, there was plenty of room for creativity and we were able to experiment with different technologies,â said Al Baker. Al Kuwari added: âOur priority was for Laâeeb to entertain fans. We wanted to create uplifting and interactive content, so we approached this in the same way we look at cinematic scripts. Getting to know Laâeeb is a journey everyone will go through during the tournament. The audience learned about his skills and personality during the draw â and there will be plenty more to find out during the World Cup.âThe power of storytellingFor Al Ibrahim, seeing his creation come to life on a scale of such magnitude represents a dream-turned-reality.He said: âSeeing Laâeeb everywhere is testament to the power of storytelling. He is a character that will be remembered by future generations and exposed to billions of people during the World Cup.âThis is something every content creator dreams of â and knowing Iâve contributed is something Iâll always be proud of.âFans interested in attending Qatar 2022 should click here for the latest tickets, accommodation and Hayya Card information."

A year later, we started working on parkour and established the Prodigal UPG in 2006, coining the phrase âperformance parkourâ to describe the art.Malik Diouf, the co-creator of parkour, happened to meet us when he filmed one of our original performances for his documentary and subsequently joined the team, which has been incredible. Although heâs very busy being a stunt performer and training new talent, he still works closely with us.We have performed all over the world and teach the art globally, so itâs been quite a journey so far, with ambitious plans for the future.

The fans are out in force, everyone is in good spirits and the atmosphere is uplifting. You see people from all over the world striking up conversations and friendships. We see people staying until the end of our performances â they want to have a chat, take selfies and learn more about our act. Even when we travel on the metro at the end of the night, people of all nationalities talk to us and we often see people return to watch our performances multiple times, which is a great compliment for us. As positive word-of-mouth spreads, we are seeing more people coming to watch us daily.A sports tournament reinforces the important message that human beings from across the world have much in common. Our act is visual and silent and I think that adds to its universal appeal. Weâre delighted it brings everyone together, while also highlighting key messages. For example, one of our pieces reflects the rise and prominence of womenâs football. Weâve noticed a natural spirit and friendliness of people here. It is pleasant, safe, jovial and respectful. Opposing fans are having sing-offs in the street and it is all done in good jest. The banter and camaraderie have been fun to see. What are your overall impressions of Qatar?We first performed here back in 2014 when we collaborated with the British Council. We were also fortunate to do performances in Kuwait and Oman at that time.We found Qatar charming back in 2014 â but seeing it now, in 2022, and the scale at which it has developed, is mind-blowing. The skyline is almost unrecognisable, the metro is incredible and the overall infrastructure is very impressive. During our first visit, we performed at Souq Waqif but this time we couldnât quite work out where we had performed until we noticed a shoe shop. As we looked around, we realised just how much everything had evolved since our last visit.Which team are you supporting during the World Cup?Well, our team is always very united, however we do have a variety of answers to this question! One person is supporting Ghana, while another cheers for Iran. We also have someone backing Saudi Arabia, and another supporting England. Then thereâs a couple of us who always cheer for the underdogs.You can catch Prodigal UPGâs performances next to the UK pavilion at the Museum of Islamic Art Park daily at 4:30 PM, 6 PM, 7 PM and 8 PM.Fans interested in attending Qatar 2022 should click here for the latest tickets, accommodation and Hayya Card information.

Then thereâs me, the youngest in the family. Iâm the youngest female football coach in Qatar with Al Arabi womenâs team.âAfnanâs football journey began with her father, during his coaching days.âGrowing up, I remember going with my dad to Al Markhiya Sports Club when he was the coach. I was too young to understand the game or what was going on â but I used to sit on the benches and try to understand the sport,â said Afnan.âIn time, I learned more about football at school. I remember seeing my brothers come home with medals and trophies and I used to ask what theyâre for. I slowly began to understand football and what was going on. My brother Afif taught me about the game and Ali and Akram supported me all the way until I fell in love with it and became a coach.âAfnan is also incredibly proud that Qatar is hosting the first FIFA World Cup in the Middle East and Arab world.She said: âAs a Qatari, I am beyond proud of this milestone. This will go down in the history books â the fact that an Arab country persevered and was able to host the biggest sporting event so seamlessly and successfully is a huge achievement.âFans interested in attending Qatar 2022 should click here for the latest tickets, accommodation and Hayya Card information."

73,14 November 2022,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/understanding-the-legacy-has-helped-me-tell-the-story-of-qatars-world-cup,"With the FIFA World Cupâ¢ only days away, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, in close collaboration with FIFA, is wrapping up preparations for the tournament and the legacy it will deliver.â¢In this new series, Making History, we are focusing on the work of Qatari employees who have played a key role in the SCâs journey.Our interview today is with Fatma Al Nuaimi, Executive Director, Communications & Media, who joined the SC from ICT Qatar in 2012.Tell us about your background and growing up in Qatar.I come from a football family. My dad â Ali Al Nuaimi â was an ambassador and a big football fan. My uncle was one of the founding members of Qatar Sports Club. The moment people see my name, they automatically know Iâm a Qatar Sports Club fan. Where did you go to university and what were your aspirations growing up?I studied English language and literature at Qatar University. I also did my Masters there. Growing up, I was inspired by my dad, so international relations and languages interested me. However, technology was my main interest. Itâs everywhere and you can see how itâs improving peopleâs lives.One event that inspired me when I was younger was the Asian Games in Doha. I attended the opening and followed all the news about it. I was too young to be part of the workforce but I wished I was involved. I felt it was a missed opportunity â I wish I had volunteered or done something to support it. However, it inspired me to volunteer for future sporting events. I met people through volunteering at sporting events who I now work with at the SC. Like everyone, I never thought the World Cup would be hosted here â so it feels like we have been given a golden opportunity to work on something even bigger than the Asian Games.Tell us about your career. I started my career with ICT Qatar in 2007. At the time, Qatar was booming and a lot of entities were being established as the country was looking to move away from oil and gas. I started with the information security team, specifically communications and outreach. At this time, technology was being adapted for different sectors, like health and education. Our work helped to open up the market and establish a whole new ecosystem. Later I worked in the ICT and society department.One person who inspired me was Her Excellency Hessa Al Jaber, the former Minister for Information Communications & Technology. She made sure we â as fresh graduates â were involved in everything. If there was a board meeting or strategy session, she would have young people there to see how decisions are made. She wanted us to understand every part of the business. She helped us all to understand the bigger picture.  Where were you when Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup and how did you feel?We had a family gathering and were all watching TV. I cried after the announcement. I had feelings of pride and happiness. I was also thinking of my dad, who had passed away earlier that year. I wished I could tell my dad we had won the bid.Winning was a dream. I knew it was something big. Even if we didnât win, the fact we put ourselves out there, it was still an achievement. But winning was amazing. It was unimaginable for so many people. How keen were you to be involved in the delivery of the tournament?Very keen. I remember at that time, Qatar was also bidding to host the 2020 Olympics and there was a competition run by the bid committee to design a website for Doha 2020. You had to come up with ideas, functionality, innovation. My friend and I partnered up and we managed to win. There were more than 2,000 applications from across the region and the final was at Katara, with Sheikha Al Mayassa on the jury. That gave us both a bit of profile. We won QAR 100,000 and got to engage with the bid team. Qatar didnât win the bid in the end but that experience was so valuable. After we won, a colleague at the SC called me and asked me to come for an interview for the Legacy department. Tell us about your career with the SC.I was involved in social and human legacy projects when I joined. I worked on the Josoor Institute project and was involved in setting it up. I helped to develop the Challenge 22 innovation competition â which was similar to the competition I won with my friend. There, I had been on the receiver side, so I knew how we could work with businesses to build the project. I was also involved in strategy before moving to Communications. Now, I have a much wider scope: digital, content, media relations, community engagement, ambassadors and much more. Working in legacy â from the stage where our ideas were only on paper â has helped me a lot in my current role. Knowing the strategy makes the projects easier to communicate about. Thatâs been the great bridge between my roles at the SC. What are your favourite memories of your time at the SC?There are so many â itâs hard to pick one. A few days ago, we had a meeting with the whole team and it was wonderful to see everyone all ready for the tournament. When I look back over the last 10 years, no matter how beautiful our stadiums are or the other facilities, it all comes down to people. And seeing everyone there â like-minded and with the same spirit â I could see we are heading in the right direction. It was a proud moment and emotional because it is the final chapter. I could see everyone is unified. Everyone at the SC is like a second family to me. I always try to have close connections to my team. How will you feel when the opening match kicks off at Al Bayt Stadium?I will feel itâs real â and at that moment Iâll try and catch my breath. Right now, weâre just waiting for the fans to come and enjoy themselves. Everything is ready â and when the tournament finally kicks off, I will be emotional. Iâm sure I will be proud too.And what about the final at Lusail Stadium â how will you feel when the trophy is lifted on 18 December?Iâll be filled with pride but at the same time I wonât be able to believe itâs the end. Weâve been working on the same project for the last 10 years and there will be mixed emotions. Delivering a World Cup is not a normal business. Itâs 24/7, itâs demanding, thereâs pressure. Iâm not sure how Iâll go back to a quiet life.Whatâs next for you â in 2023 and beyond?I think Iâll have a holiday first and then focus on telling the story of Qatar 2022. As a communications team, we will have a lot of work to do. We need to look at the sustainability of the event, the economic impact and narrate the story of how the World Cup will boost Qatar long into the future. There will still be plenty of work for us to do next year. For me, I love to be involved in transformational projects. Qatar has changed so much in recent years. So many things have opened. People will see the fan experience and entertainment options during the World Cup, and these things will continue to enhance the community and quality of life in Qatar. Itâs crucial we keep working hard to develop our country. "

Among the first players to touchdown in Doha were representatives from the United States of America, with several members of Gregg Berhalterâs Group B aspirants arriving at Hamad International Airport on Thursday evening.

Like several national team managers, Berhalter announced his squad for the forthcoming FIFA World Cup this week, naming 26 players on his roster to challenge England, Wales, and Iran throughout the group phase.

The USA â a co-host of the FIFA World Cup in 2026 â will feature at their 11th FIFA World Cup in 2022, with their best result in the tournament coming in the inaugural edition in Uruguay in 1930 when they finished third.

Jesus Ferreira, Sean Johnson, Aaron Long, Jordan Morris, Walker Zimmerman, Kellyn Acosta, DeAndre Yedlin, Cristian Roldan and Shaq Moore were among the first batch of FIFA World Cup stars to set foot in Qatar, and they will be joined by hundreds more over the coming days, as the 32 participating nations get set to pursue world footballâs greatest prize.

Berhalter cannot wait for USAâs FIFA World Cup quest to commence.

âWe believe we have a talented group, a strong team spirit, and one that is ready to compete. We are extremely proud and honoured to represent the United States and appreciate all the amazing support from our fans in Qatar,â he said."

80,10 November 2022,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/qatars-revolutionary-stadium-cooling-technology,"With innovation and sustainability at the heart of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ preparations, cooling technology is one of the tournamentâs major success stories. The revolutionary system was first showcased during the inauguration of Khalifa International Stadium in 2017 and since then has been adapted to benefit six more tournament venues, as well as other facilities across the country.With Qatarâs World Cup taking place in November and December, the pressure on cooling systems will be limited, with outside temperatures estimated to be 18-24Â°C. The technology will, however, allow sporting events to be held all-year-round, in addition to other activities, like shopping and farming.Energy-efficient cooling systems were developed following Qatarâs successful bid for the World Cup, with the technology delivered by the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy in collaboration with Qatar University (QU). Dr. Saud Abdulaziz Abdul Ghani, Professor of Engineering at QU, played a key role in the cooling journey, which started with his university studies decades earlier.âMy PhD study focused on air conditioning in a car and we applied the same theory to our World Cup stadiums â but obviously on a much bigger scale,â said Dr. Saud.The technology is now fitted in seven of eight Qatar 2022 stadiums, with the only exception Stadium 974, which is fully-demountable and features natural ventilation. Each of the other venueâs cooling technology is different and made to fit its unique design and features. Using solar-powered energy, outside air is cooled and then distributed through grills in the stands and large pitch-side nozzles. The systems use insulation and spot cooling to make them as environmentally-friendly as possible.âSpot cooling means we only cool the areas where people need it â like on the pitch and in the stands,â said Dr. Saud. âThe form of each stadium acts as a barrier, which contains a cold bubble inside. Our air circulation technique cools the air, filters it and pushes it out towards the players and fans. Each stadium is cooled to a comfortable temperature of around 20 degrees, with spot cooling enhancing our commitment to sustainability and the environment.â "

85,7 November 2022,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/the-world-cup-has-transformed-qatar-im-proud-to-be-a-part-of-it,"With only weeks to go until Qatar hosts the first FIFA World Cupâ¢ in the Middle East and Arab world, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), in close collaboration with FIFA, is wrapping up preparations for the tournament and the legacy it will deliver.In this new series, we are focusing on the work of Qatari employees who have played a key role in the SCâs journey. This week, we speak to Thani Al Zarraa, who joined the SC in 2012 and has worked on a range of projects over the last decade, including stadium developments, legacy programmes and transport management. What were you doing when Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup?I fondly remember it. It was 2 December 2010. At that time, I was a graduate student impatiently waiting for graduation day in Australia. My friends and colleagues from Gulf countries got together to watch the announcement. We were all wearing bid T-shirts to show our support. Australia was also part of the bid, so when we heard the news, we were ecstatic! We went out into the streets to celebrate. Were you a football fan growing up?Tell us about your journey working at the SC.Back in 2012, we only had plans on paper and feasibility studies, which werenât even complete. Back then, I was with the legacy department and we used to create legacy benefit case studies to explore the potential use of World Cup venues after the tournament. We used to conduct focus groups with local communities to ask them how they could benefit from World Cup facilities and to find out any concerns they had. Later, I moved into construction and eventually became Al Janoub Stadium Project Director.How has working at the SC impacted your career?Itâs been incredibly valuable. Iâve had the opportunity to take part in international events on secondment and observation programmes. These offered great insight into venue management and how mega-events are organised. I attended the UEFA Champions League final in 2017 between Juventus and Real Madrid and was with the project team in charge of dressing and signage, making sure all the overlay was ready. During the 2019 Copa America, I was an assistant venue manager in Rio. We were responsible for the Estadio do MaracanÃ£, two team hotels and two training sites. I am so grateful for all these experiences and much more over the last 10 years. They have given me the ability so build technical expertise and reach my current role working in transport. Tell us about your current role and how it is supporting the tournament.I work in transport management. I believe that transport, after the venues, is the main artery of any mega-event. As part of my role, I ensure that different transportation projects in the country are being delivered to a high standard â as part of our bid commitments to FIFA. We are making sure the different transport options, whether bus, metro, tram or taxi, work efficiently for our different constituent groups, including fans and players. We consider the whole experience â from the moment people arrive at the airport to the moment they depart. We work closely with a range of stakeholders to make sure our plans are streamlined and communicated effectively. Another key aspect of our operations during the tournament will be the command centre, where we will gather all transport elements under one umbrella and review their operations continuously during the tournament. What do you hope fans experience, in terms of transportation services, during the World Cup?I think the compact nature of the tournament is a huge advantage â but we are encouraging all fans and visitors to plan their journeys carefully. I think fans will be amazed how close everything is â from their accommodation to stadiums to fan zones. We have worked very hard to cater for everyone and ensure their journeys are as smooth as possible. What does your typical day at the SC look like? My favourite part of the day is early morning. I get up at 4:30 AM to exercise. Then I come to the office and itâs usually very quiet, as you would expect at that time. I have a coffee and plan my agenda for the day. Iâm usually in meetings or on calls throughout. There are always new challenges. No day is the same. What mark do you hope to leave in your experience working for the SC?Well, I think it works both ways, because Qatar has given us many opportunities. We are very lucky to be given the resources and facilities and then be given the chance to contribute to the success of the tournament and the country overall. Which moment from your career at the SC is the most memorable?I was part of the inauguration of Khalifa International Stadium in 2017. Al Janoub Stadium was another big milestone for me. I was part of the venue management team at the inauguration and the project team during construction. Both stadiums are very close to my heart. I can actually spot both of them on a clear day from my office window. These two moments, in May 2017 and May 2019, are very precious to me.What will you cherish most from this experience?Many things! The people that work here and the speed at which Qatar has delivered everything are admirable. The World Cup really has transformed our nation and placed it on the global stage. I am honoured to be part of this story. Who influenced you during your time at the SC?The late Hilal Al Kuwari is a personality I will never forget. I remember meeting Engineer Hilal before I worked at the SC when I wanted to conduct a feasibility study for my degree. I bumped into a consultant who was working on a major project for Qatar and they advised me to consult the project manager, who, at that time, was Engineer Hilal. Then I met him officially at the SC, when I worked with him in 2014. His energy and love for knowledge were incomparable and very infectious. He was keen on giving us the right knowledge and tools to succeed. I recall every time my colleagues and I would sit with him, we would want to make sure we were prepared with questions. He had a bulk of knowledge and eagerness to share it. He is definitely someone that I learned from. It was a great pleasure getting to know him. Whatâs on the horizon for you after the World Cup?Career-wise, I would love to keep working in the sports industry. Sport management is something I have become very passionate about, whether through my role with the SC or my hobby with the cycling federation. "

The overarching goal is to ensure all the waste generated at stadiums and fan zones is recycled, composted or converted to green energy.âWith the responsibility of hosting the FIFA World Cup came an even larger responsibility to avoid leaving an impact on Qatarâs environment. We started early in our journey to try to minimise the amount of waste being sent to landfill,â said Eng. Bodour Al Meer, the SCâs Sustainability Executive Director.âDuring the design and construction of our stadiums, significant focus was placed on minimising and recycling construction waste. During the operations of our stadiums, the focus is now on avoidance, minimisation, segregation, recycling and recovery,â added Al Meer.Work to deliver this achievement forms a critical part of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ Sustainability Strategy. Extensive testing took place during the FIFA Arab Cup 2021â¢. Waste generated from the 19-day tournament was segregated into organic, plastic, metal, electronic and cardboard. Remaining waste was sent to the Ministry of Municipalityâs Domestic Solid Waste Management Centre for further treatment in a waste-to-energy plant. During the tournament, each stadium recycled at least 42% of the waste generated, with the remainder converted to green energy. Al Bayt Stadium recycled more than 70% of the waste generated during the tournament.âOur work in the Arab Cup proved we can deliver a large-scale event without sending waste to landfill. Our goal is to replicate this success during the World Cup and set a new standard in hosting sustainable mega sporting events,â said Al Meer.âWhile we will continue to do our best, waste is everyoneâs responsibility. Therefore, we encourage fans to support our efforts by putting their waste in the correct bin,â added Al Meer.âWhile we will continue to do our best, waste is everyoneâs responsibility.

Hiking gives me a sense of freedom and I wanted to share this passion and love with the millions of fans that are eagerly awaiting the first World Cup in the region,â added Al Salmi, a passionate Green Falcons fan.âI hope that our national team hears of my walk, and that inspires them to do their best in the tournament. I want to show everyone that nothing is impossible, and that with hard work and determination, you can do anything,â added Al Salmi.After arriving at the Doha Corniche, Al Salmi was greeted by throngs of supporters from across Qatar. Fans congratulated him on his tremendous feat, while posing for photographs with him under the Saudi flag.âThe amazing reception Iâve received has been tremendous. As soon as I crossed the Qatari border, people met me with flowers and food. This World Cup has also been about bringing people together and I hope my journey inspires others to walk towards each other â to cross boundaries, to get to know each other, and break the stereotypes that so many of us in this region have to contend with,â said Al Salmi."

You can organise great tours and do so many fun things. There are also many things to do in Doha â amazing places like Souq Waqif and Msheireb. I also love the beaches here. Uruguayans love going to the beach, so Iâm sure they will enjoy Qatar.Itâs important to learn about the culture â it is obviously different here to many other countries. My advice to people is to plan everything in advance and do some research. I think itâs important to embrace the culture and respect local people. Always try to be flexible, as this will help you enjoy your experience here.Many fans have asked me questions about the tournament. Most ask about accommodation and the best places to stay. The good thing is this tournament is very compact â you will never be far from a hotel, stadium or fan zone during this World Cup.They will bring their traditions and energy. Uruguayans will want to show they are proud. We will be very visible â it will seem like there are many thousands of us! It means a lot to Uruguayans to be part of the World Cup."

91,3 November 2022,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/delivering-the-world-cup-shows-future-generations-they-can-do-anything,"With only weeks to go before the first FIFA World Cupâ¢ in the Middle East and Arab world, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), in close collaboration with FIFA, is wrapping up preparations for the tournament. In this new series, Making History, we are focusing on the work of Qatari employees who have played a key role in the SCâs journey. Today, we speak to Khaled Al Suwaidi, Stakeholder Relations Director. He joined the SC in August 2022 after previously working for the Ministry of Finance. Khaled holds a degree in petroleum engineering from Texas A&M University at Qatar and a Masterâs degree in strategic business unit management from HEC Paris. Why did you join the SC? Joining the SC was an easy decision for me. Growing up, football shaped my childhood. All I ever did was play football in the neighbourhood with my friends. When the opportunity came to join this project, it felt right. This is the biggest sporting event in the world â I had to be a part of it. I wanted to give back to my beloved country. This is a nationâs dream so itâs only right that we fulfill our national duty and contribute to making it happen. What do you remember about the day Qatar won the bid to host the FIFA World Cupâ¢?I remember I had just arrived in Houston, Texas, as part of my first work assignment abroad with ExxonMobil. I was surrounded by my Qatari friends when the announcement was made. I felt goosebumps knowing that Qatar will make its footprint everywhere when it hosts the biggest football event. It feels like it was just yesterday. Did you ever dream you would get the chance to work on this mega-event?At the time, I was mostly focused on engineering as a career. However, over the years, my interests changed and I switched career paths. Thankfully everything worked out. Tell us about your role at the SC and how youâre helping to deliver the tournament.I am currently leading the Community Engagement division at the SC. Through my role, I oversee the SCâs relationship with local stakeholders, as well as our community engagement efforts. I also manage the cultural experience element of the tournament, including activations. Everyone has a role to play in the success of this tournament. Our role involves overseeing our communication with key stakeholders and ensuring a seamless working relationship because they are the core of this mega project.What are some accomplishments you are proud of? The Community Engagement division has had various accomplishments during each milestone which significantly enhanced the fan experience.It satisfies us to see fans enjoying the matches and activations, and this leaves us with a sense of accomplishment. The trophy tour that took place during Eid was a great example of our community engagement efforts, which created buzz and excitement ahead of the World Cup. The closest milestone to my heart is the inauguration of Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium, because it was the first match post-pandemic and it was great seeing all the fans come back together. It was also the first milestone I worked on after joining the SC, which makes it special.How would you describe the team dynamic at the SC? At the SC, weâre truly a family. I am beyond lucky to have a team like mine. The team is energetic, positive, happy and passionate. No matter the pressure and challenges, the team is always ready to deliver amazing, and to the best of their abilities. What does a typical day at the SC look like? I donât think a typical day exists at the SC. Every day brings new surprises and challenges. I would say the typical day begins in the morning and ends the following morning. What are some challenges you encounter?  I love challenges. They bring out an innovative side to all of us. The biggest challenge weâre facing is time, or the lack of it. We are only days away from hosting the first World Cup in the Middle East and Arab world. Preparations started more than a decade ago, and we are now applying the final touches. In many ways, the final touches are just as important as the groundwork. What does it mean to you to be a part of the SC?Being a part of this event means being a part of history. It means giving back to our beloved country. Qatar has done so much for us. This is the least that it deserves and we should all give back to the country. This event will leave everyone proud, including future generations.What will you cherish the most from this experience?The memories I created with my team and our daily encounters and human interactions is what Iâll cherish the most.What is your favourite memory at the SC?My favourite memory is last October during the inauguration of Al Thumama Stadium. The amount of work and effort put into this inauguration was more than any other opening. When the final whistle went we all felt a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction seeing our work pay off. It was a beautiful moment. What kind of legacy do you want to leave behind for future generations? Personally, I want to tell future generations that ambition knows no limitation. Nothing is impossible. We are delivering the World Cup; future generations can do anything."

In collaboration with our global partners, we are proud to continue to provide opportunities for female youth from across the region to engage in thought-provoking, educationally-significant opportunities to learn, interact and share their experiences from experts in the field of leadership and personal development. As the social impact legacy initiative of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, we aim to equip all youth engaged through Generation Amazing programmes with global competency skills so that they can be best positioned to think and act pro-socially now and in their future.ââOur mission at Qatar Foundation is to unlock human potential â and we believe that this happens through education, capacity building and skills development. With nearly 70% of women making up our student body and with the excitement of the World Cup increasing participation and opportunities in sport here in Qatar, we know that providing females with pathways and leadership skills in football industries is a meaningful way to support our community. Thatâs why we are hosting events such as this special edition of Future Leaders in Football workshop around the upcoming FIFA World Cup. Additionally, once the tournament ends, Education City Stadium will become an educational, leisure and sporting facility that will serve as a hub for learning, creativity and discovery, focused specifically on women and girls,â said Machaille Hassan Al Naimi, Strategic Initiatives Executive Officer at Qatar Foundation.Mansoor Al Ansari, QFA General Secretary, said: ""It has been a privilege to join hands with our partners to organise and host this workshop. Such initiatives demonstrate football's ability to be used as a tool to bring about positive social change in communities and achieve important social goals such as equality and access to valuable knowledge. We are confident that our female participants benefited greatly from this experience and developed new skills to help them grow into socially conscious leaders.""He added: ""To welcome young women from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Oman, Iraq, Palestine, Bahrain, Sudan, Morocco, Germany, Syria and Jordan was truly a momentous occasion for us. If the game is to develop, we need young women and men working together for a common cause. We thank our Qatari and international partners for putting this workshop together.""Ahead of Euro 2024, which will be hosted in Germany, the DFB developed the FLF workshop in cooperation with BMZ and GIZ, which was carried out digitally for the first time as part of Euro 2020 in 2021. The goal of FLF is to use football as an effective tool for developing skills and competencies for socially responsible leaders to proactively lead the way for sustainable and positive social change. The target group is 18Heike Ullrich, General Secretary of the DFB, said âIn less than three weeks' time, one of the biggest sporting events of all, the FIFA World Cup, is going to open here in Qatar. This is perceived by many as an impetus for positive change, and that's how it should be. Change is always future-oriented, and this is reflected by the very name of the course â the third female edition of FLF. It is also symbolic, because it is aimed at a group that used to be shamefully under-represented in the football of the past â but that will help shape the future of this sport and ensure that it has a good future.â"

And while all are memorable for different reasons, he is especially excited about the next one in Qatar, which will get underway on 20 November.âThe World Cup in Qatar will introduce everyone to the Arab world,â said Al Temyat, who scored 11 goals in 63 appearances for the Green Falcons. âIt will showcase our talents and capabilities, and show our youth what can be achieved. Everyone in the region is excited to invite people from across the globe to experience our culture, heritage and the richness of our history.âQatar 2022, which will be held in eight state-of-the-art stadiums, will feature four nations from the Arab world, with the host nation being joined by Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Tunisia. It will be a sixth World Cup appearance for Al Temyatâs Saudis, who have been drawn in Group C alongside Argentina, Mexico and Poland, and they will be backed by thousands of fans who will travel in large numbers to support their team.Former Al Hilal star Al Temyat said: âI was pleased to see our team qualify comfortably. Our players will be very familiar with the stadiums and great weather. They will also have a lot of support.ââThe tournament will not be easy. Success in qualification and doing well at the World Cup are two very different things. Having 10 players who have already played in a World Cup will be a great boost for us but we will need to play at a higher pace to compete against other teams. At the end of the day, nothing is impossible, and I hope we can do something special at the World Cup in Qatar.âAl Temyat, a former Asian player of the year, went on to speak of the unifying power of football and his excitement ahead of Qatar 2022.

97,1 November 2022,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/whether-youre-new-or-experienced-teamwork-determines-everything,"With only weeks to go until Qatar hosts the first FIFA World Cupâ¢ in the Middle East and Arab world, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), in close collaboration with FIFA, is wrapping up preparations for the tournament and the legacy it will deliver.In this new series, Making History, we are focusing on the work of Qatari employees who have played a key role in the SCâs journey. Our first interview is with Maryam Hamad Al Muftah, Executive Director, ICT Event Operations. Maryam, from Al Wakrah, joined the SC in 2013 after studying computer engineering at Qatar University and graduating in 2007. She obtained a Masterâs degree from HEC Paris before joining the SC from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). Why did you join the SC and why were you interested in working on this mega-project?It was an amazing opportunity to leave my comfort zone. I like event management and I enjoy working with people from different cultures and backgrounds. So, joining the SC was a unique opportunity â and a World Cup in this region will only happen once for my generation. I felt there was no better way to use my skills and I knew the role would help me grow in so many ways.When you were growing up, did you ever think you would work on a World Cup?It never crossed my mind. I was a fresh graduate when Qatar won the bid and there was so much attention on the World Cup. Everyone in Qatar wanted to work on the project. I didnât know if I would have the opportunity at first â but as time went on, I was more and more eager to join the team and help to âDeliver Amazingâ.When the role at the SC became available I was planning to take a break from my job at QIA â so the SCâs timing was perfect. Back then I became the Manager of Infrastructure in the IT Department and never imagined I would be here now, in the thick of tournament preparations.What do you remember about the day Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup?It was such a special day for everyone in the country. I think everyone has their own story about it. I was at the Four Seasons hotel for a family wedding. We were all watching the TV anxiously waiting for the announcement. Afterwards, we were all ecstatic. How did you get interested in IT? Itâs always been a passion of mine. I like the fact the IT field is generally a few steps ahead of other industries. It is technological and always trying to innovate. As soon as I graduated, I knew I needed to follow this passion.Tell us about your role at the SC and how youâre helping to deliver the tournament.I currently manage the Information Communications Technology division and lead on all technological aspects of the tournament. When we first won the bid, Qatar announced it would deliver a smart World Cup, so technology became an important part of our infrastructure and crucial for planning a seamless tournament. Tell us about your team spirit and collaboration. One of my biggest accomplishments is the team dynamic. I am very proud of every one of them. My team is great â weâre like a family. We work together seamlessly with the goal of delivering a successful tournament. This tournament requires solid expertise and a team that can deliver under pressure. We have overcome multiple challenges together and are excited to take on new ones. When the pandemic first hit, my team was ready to work through it and we came out of this successfully. I am honoured to say we are ready to deliver a smart World Cup. Which project has been the most rewarding and why?During the FIFA Arab Cup, we managed a range of projects, including international connectivity, the implementation of mobile/tetra/radio devices in stadiums, and the optical transport network that carries event IT network and broadcast network traffic. We worked closely with the Communications Regulatory Authority in order to meet FIFA obligations and delivered a number of projects in a short timeframe, including the command centre and press conference area. The work we put in allowed broadcasters to take the highest quality footage in the quickest possible time â which is one achievement we are truly proud of.What services will the IT department manage during the World Cup?We will build on the work we delivered during the FIFA Arab Cup. We will be managing networks and supporting radio and broadcast services. We will be specifically responsible for providing broadcast connectivity, which will help media to broadcast matches all around the world. We will also provide back-up solutions for broadcast connectivity, such as the satellite back-up. Our work makes me confident that fans here in Qatar and across the globe will experience the World Cup of a lifetime.What are some challenges you encounter in your role and what advice would you give to the next generation of IT professionals?Being a Qatari woman working in the sports sector can be challenging, however I have managed to overcome that. Another challenge is women working in the technology industry generally, as it tends to be male-dominated. However, I have found that nothing is difficult where there is teamwork. Whether youâre new or experienced, teamwork determines everything. How do you think the World Cup will impact Qatar and the region?I think this is just the beginning for Qatar. The attention we have had means we will be more open to investors, tourists and jobseekers. I think the country will continue to evolve and look to build a greater degree of sustainability for future generations. I think this is just the beginning for Qatar. The attention we have had means we will be more open to investors, tourists and jobseekers. I think the country will continue to evolve and look to build a greater degree of sustainability for future generations. What will you cherish most from this experience and how will you feel when the trophy is lifted at Lusail Stadium on 18 December?I will cherish all the memories that I made here, and the deep bonds we created. We are truly a family at the SC. After the final, tears of joy, happiness and humbleness will flow. Witnessing what we made will definitely give me goosebumps.  What does the future hold for you beyond 2022? What are your ambitions?Iâm very keen to continue my work in ICT. It is a broad field and constantly evolving â and this is what motivates me for the future. I would like to continue working in a fast-paced field and remain at the forefront of technological advancements, while always seeking to acquire new skills. "

103,28 October 2022,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/japanese-fans-are-proud-to-see-the-world-cup-back-in-asia,"When the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ gets underway on 20 November, it will only be the second time the tournament has been held in Asia.Twenty years ago, co-hosts Japan and Korea Republic became the first Asian countries to stage international footballâs showpiece event. And this year, in Qatar, Asian pride will be shared again, with Japanese fans ready to celebrate the beautiful game with supporters from across the globe.Ready to welcome Samurai Blue fans to Qatar is Lusail resident Masaaki Hayashi. The 38-year-old, originally from Kawasaki, has lived in Qatar for the last three years working as a senior analyst in the oil and gas industry.Masaaki is looking forward to welcoming fans from the Land of the Rising Sun, as Qatar stages the first World Cup in the Middle East and Arab world.After Japan and the Korea Republic co-hosted the World Cup in 2002, how excited are Japanese fans to see the tournament being staged in another Asian country?They are very proud, as this is a special opportunity. Being a Japanese fan in Qatar, Iâm really proud that I will be able to be part of this World Cup and see it first-hand. For all Japanese, I think this is one of the major events of the year.    Having seen the impact of hosting the 2002 World Cup on Japan, how do you think the tournament will benefit Qatar and the region?Football was already a popular sport in Japan back in 2002, but hosting the World Cup further boosted its popularity, especially among young people. During my time in Qatar, I find local people support football in general, so I see similar positive impacts taking place here, as it did back in Japan two decades ago.    What advice would you give to Japan fans who are planning to travel to Qatar?Japanese fans should search online and learn about the cultural differences. My general advice is to do your research â it is important to gather as much information as possible. What are the top places to visit in Qatar?I would say the first place to visit is Souq Waqif, which offers a very Middle Eastern experience. Apart from that, there are four or five beautiful museums. They are well located and easy to access, so I would definitely encourage people to visit them to understand more about the culture and art of the country and region. I also recommend The Pearl and Lusail, which are both new and modern areas.     "

The event, which is part of a series of community of practice meetings focused on behavioural economics, was attended by educators and policy makers who discussed the role of bureaucrats in designing happy user journeys.The session featured keynote speaker Dr. Wolfgang Drechsler, Professor of Governance at the Ragnar Nurkse Department of Innovation and Governance, Tallinn University of Technology; Honorary Professor, University College Londonâs Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose; and Associate Professor at Harvard Universityâs Davis Center.Dr. Drechslerâs research focuses on organisation behaviour, public administration and governance. He spoke to attendees about the need for bureaucrats to step in and open a public discussion about what will make people happy in such environments and advocated for agility and stability in public administration, which can then bring public value to citizens.âPeople like me are probably the only ones in the world who do not use the word âbureaucratâ as an insult, but as a functional term for public servants. Without them, we know that a lack of innovative experience or knowledge-based society can lead to a lack of happiness,â said Dr. Drechsler. âEven if bureaucrats think like ordinary citizens, they still need to be able to look at the types of techno-economic development, and that is a huge challenge.â"

This week, we speak to Faisal Khalid, Ambassador Programme Manager. Faisal, from Al Rayyan, joined the SC in October 2019 after studying abroad and obtaining a degree in accounting. What do you remember about the day Qatar won the bid to host the FIFA World Cupâ¢?I think every Qatari who witnessed Qatar winning the bid will cherish this memory forever. I remember I was away on a trip with friends and we were watching the TV in a coffee shop. The crowd suddenly cheered and we celebrated on the streets. There are no words to describe my feelings on that day. I felt a combination of pride and excitement. I canât believe we are now in 2022. It feels like we just won the bid yesterday.Did you ever dream you would get the chance to work on this mega-event?I never once thought I would be a part of the team to deliver this mega-event. Thank God I was approached with the opportunity and I believed in it and took it. I am honoured to be a part of this project. Tell us about your role at the SC and how youâre helping to deliver the tournament.I work as part of the Ambassadors Programme. This encompasses both the Qatar Legacy Ambassadors Programme and the FIFA Ambassadors Programme. I am the focal point for all local and regional ambassadors, including former Qatar national team players and others from the region, like Ali Al Habsi.A typical day involves coordinating and communicating with FIFA legends and ambassadors. We work with internal teams such as Generation Amazing and Fan Engagement, who sometimes request ambassadors for specific activations. The Ambassadors Programme is responsible for ensuring a seamless collaboration with ambassadors, and thinking of creative ways to best showcase them for the benefit of Qatar and the tournament.As we all know, this is the first FIFA World Cup in the Middle East and Arab world, so itâs crucial to promote it in the best and most effective way possible through our numerous ambassadors. We have a variety of local and international ambassadors and FIFA legends that showcase the tournament and everything Qatar will offer. What are some accomplishments you are proud of? Since I joined the SC, I have been lucky enough to take part in many tournaments, like the FIFA Club World Cup, Arabian Gulf Cup and FIFA Arab Cup. Every milestone makes me proud. It feels great to be part of such an amazing team.How would you describe the team dynamic at the SC? When it comes to the team, we are diverse in every aspect. We have experts from all over the world, from different cultures and backgrounds. Every day, you are bound to meet, cross paths and work with someone new. Itâs one of the best parts about working here.What are some challenges you encounter?  Working around the clock is a daily challenge we face here at the SC. Dealing with ambassadors and working around their time zones and schedules is a challenge. For example, our Brazilian ambassadors, like Cafu, have completely different working hours to us. What does it mean to you to be a part of the SC?Being a part of this tournament means being a part of the countryâs history. I will forever be proud of my role at the SC and contributing to the success of the World Cup. I donât think our generation will witness a similar mega-event in our lifetime, so it fills me with pride. Did you form any personal relationships with the ambassadors? Growing up, I have always loved video games and I would always play FIFA and choose the FIFA legends as players. I always looked up to them. So when the opportunity came to work in the programme, it was a dream come true. I now communicate with these legends, like Cafu, Samuel Etoâo and Ronald de Boer, on a daily basis, and we have formed great friendships over the years. What kind of legacy do you want the World Cup to leave behind? I want future generations to benefit from this tournament. They should know that anything is possible â dreams really do come true. I used to dream about meeting these players â and all of a sudden, they are part of my daily routine. This World Cup should inspire everyone in Qatar and across our region."

118,14 October 2022,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/qatari-culture-is-all-about-welcoming-people,"On 14 June at Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium, Costa Rica became the 32nd and final team to qualify for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ when they defeated New Zealand in an intercontinental play-off. The result was received with joy and happiness in the Central American country â and among thousands of Los Ticos fans who attended the match.Among those supporters was Doha-based Maria Fernanda Borloz. The Heredia native, who currently lives in Al Muntazah, has spent the past year in Qatar working as a flight attendant.Borloz, 30, believes Costa Rica fans are ready to contribute plenty of colour and passion to this yearâs FIFA World Cupâ¢. What was it like to witness Costa Ricaâs qualification for Qatar 2022?Honestly, it was one of the best days of my life, a dream come true. I was with colleagues from India, Pakistan and Qatar, all supporting my team, which was beautiful. There were also friends of mine here from Costa Rica, so it was an amazing night.         We saw how passionate the Costa Rica fans are in June â what can we expect from Los Ticos supporters during the World Cup?We will be supporting our team, everywhere it goes, and everyone will be able to experience our âpura vidaâ culture, which means âpure lifeâ. Costa Rica fans are very lively and like to enjoy these experiences as much as possible. Itâs not a secret that Costa Rica was called one of the happiest countries in the world, so we are looking forward to sharing our passion and joy here in Qatar.           What advice would you give fellow Costa Rica fans about the country and the region?I recommend they research a little bit to learn about the culture here, in order to be respectful of Qatarâs customs and traditions. From my experience, the lifestyle here is much like home, so there is nothing to be afraid of. Itâs important to try and embrace Qatari culture because itâs all about welcoming people. Qataris love to meet new people.         Los Ticos will play their group matches at Al Thumama Stadium, Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium and Al Bayt Stadium. How much are you looking forward to experiencing the atmosphere at these stadiums?I expect it will be very emotional for Costa Rica fans, as these are top stadiums that we will get to see our team play in. I had a chance to be at Al Bayt Stadium for the FIFA Arab Cup final last year, so I know we will enjoy being there. Costa Rica fans will be mesmerised by these huge venues because we are not used to such big stadiums back home.   "
119,12 October 2022,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/sara-essam-the-world-cup-will-change-the-way-our-region-is-perceived,"When Sara Essam joined English club Stoke City in 2017, she became the first Arab to play in the Womenâs Super League. The trailblazing Egyptian finished her debut season as the sideâs top scorer, setting in motion a career that now sees her playing in the Spanish top division with FundaciÃ³n Albacete.Off the pitch, Essam is a FIFA World Cupâ¢ Ambassador and believes this yearâs tournament in Qatar represents a watershed moment for the sport. The tournament will be held from 20 November to 18 December in eight state-of-the-art stadiums â and Essam believes it will significantly boost the entire region, in particular the growth of womenâs sport.âWe can see there is increasing interest in all womenâs sports across the Arab world. This is very important because itâs time to recognise there is no difference between male and female athletes â both are able to be talented and hard-working,â said Essam. âI am certain that with the World Cup coming to the region for the first time, the world will start to discover the region is full of talent, and that girls in the Arab world play football as well.âThis yearâs tournament, which will get underway when hosts Qatar face Ecuador at Al Bayt Stadium, is seen as an historic event that will showcase the regionâs talent â both on the pitch and in terms of the Arab worldâs ability to host mega sporting events.âI remember when Qatar won the right to host the World Cup. As Egyptians, we were all thrilled because we knew the enormity of the decision to grant an Arab country the right to host the tournament for the first time. I particularly recall how all my friends and family were so excited to welcome everyone to this part of the world,â said Essam.With the longest distance between stadiums just 75km, Qatar 2022 will be the most compact World Cup in modern history. Tournament venues, training sites, fan zones and accommodation will be connected by a modern transportation network, including an expansive road system, the Doha Metro and bus services. Fans and players will always be in the thick of the action.âThis tournament presents us with a huge opportunity to highlight our talents in the region,â said Essam. âThis goes beyond football. The World Cup will enable us to show this region in the light it deserves. It will show the world we have made great developments and can boast world-class infrastructure.âEssam continued: âQatar 2022 will present us with a unique opportunity to invite the world into our homes. Football is a sport that unites everyone, regardless of their religious or political beliefs. Itâs a sport we all love.âEssam believes the legacy of the tournament will be felt long after the final whistle at Lusail Stadium on 18 December. Having represented Arab women footballers across the world, she knows first-hand the importance of using sport as a tool to break down stereotypes.âThe tournament will change the way the Arab world is perceived. More people will want to visit the region after the World Cup. Anyone that has preconceived biases or fears about visiting the region will witness a remarkable display and a true celebration during the World Cup. This will undoubtedly encourage them to visit Qatar and a number of countries throughout the region.âFans interested in attending Qatar 2022 should click here for the latest tickets, accommodation and Hayya Card information."

The 38-year-old former defensive midfielder appeared in four World Cups for La Albiceleste, including a run to the final in 2014. In total, he earned 147 caps for his country and scored three goals.With Qatar 2022 on the horizon, the FIFA World Cupâ¢ Ambassador gave his thoughts on this yearâs tournament, which will get underway at Al Bayt Stadium on 20 November when hosts Qatar face Ecuador.The longest distance between stadiums is just 75km in Qatar â how will the compact nature benefit the players and fans during the World Cup?It makes things easier from a logistical point of view. Fans will be able to attend more than one game a day and players will not need to travel from city to city. They will be in one place throughout the tournament â making it easier to focus on training and recovery. Itâs very positive for the players.How will the timing of this yearâs World Cup â from 20 November to 18 December â help the players?Many of the players will arrive fresher, as they will only be midway through their club seasons. We will see the players at a different level of energy compared to previous tournaments. Hopefully, the players will be able to perform at a higher level, which will be exciting for the fans. You played in South Africa 2010 â the first tournament in Africa. Qatar 2022 is the first World Cup in the Middle East and Arab world â how important will this be for the region?Football is the most popular sport in the world. It belongs to everyone. Itâs great that the Middle East will host its first World Cup. Itâs important to give new countries the opportunity to host this type of event.What can Argentina fans expect when they arrive in Qatar?Qatar is a country that invites you to come and have a great time. It is very safe and the weather will be fantastic in November and December. Itâs a great opportunity for Argentina fans to learn about the history and culture of this country and region. "

We are excited to work alongside Generation Amazing to utilise the power of sport to promote tolerance and inclusion.âGeneration Amazing has also resumed its work in Oman, which was halted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Its futuristic design is inspired by the interplay of light and shadow.

The magnificent gold faÃ§ade, shaped like a bowl, highlights motifs and elements from the golden age of artistic expression in the Islamic world. âNorman Foster, the main architect behind the stadium, studied hand-carved Islamic antiques and focused on merging a golden vase and the fanar lantern into the stadium design, leading to the magnificent venue we see today,â said Tamim El Abed, Operations Manager, Lusail Stadium.CapacityThe venue will host 80,000 fans during Qatar 2022. TransportThe stadium is within walking distance of Lusail QNB station on the Doha Metro Red Line. Drivers can access the stadium from the Al Khor Expressway.

The only goal scorer that day in Gothenburg was the legendary PelÃ©, who was just 17 years old.Fast-forward more than six decades, and Wales are once again ready to take on the worldâs best. And one man who cannot wait to see his countrymen in action in Qatar is Rhodri Williams, who has worked as a broadcaster and businessman in Doha for the last ten years.Originally from Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, Williams presents football coverage for Al Kass Sports Channels and helps to run popular Doha restaurant, The Curry House. He previously worked for the BBC, ITV, Channel 5, Sky Sports and Setanta Sports in the UK.The 54-year-old lives in West Bay with his wife, Oksana, and is looking forward to welcoming Gareth Bale and co, as Wales prepare to face England, the USA and Iran in Group B later this year.What were your emotions when Wales defeated Ukraine in the qualifying play-off to secure their spot at Qatar 2022?My father passed away in March last year and he was a huge sports fan. I felt him watching from wherever he is now and somehow giving inspirational power to our goalkeeper, Wayne Hennessey, who possibly had the game of his career that night. We were lucky, as Ukraine played brilliantly â but it went our way in the end. My overriding emotion was pride, while also thinking about my dad.Wales fans are very passionate sports fans. What can we expect from Dragons supporters in Qatar?They will come here and enjoy the full experience â including everything Qatar has to offer. I think itâs interesting with Wales because my generation never experienced us qualifying for anything. The younger generation think itâs the norm because in the last six years, weâve qualified for two European Championships and now a World Cup. It really means so much to us to have qualified, as weâve not been here since 1958. Thereâs even a slight level of expectation of how the team will do. Everyone is very excited and ready to have fun at this tournament. "

It will be the first tournament to be staged in the Middle East and Arab world â and TourÃ© is someone who can appreciate the World Cupâs journey to new frontiers.He played in all three of Ivory Coastâs FIFA World Cupâ¢ appearances to-date, including the tournamentâs maiden trip to the African continent in 2010, when South Africa took hosting duties.With Qatar 2022 fast approaching, the FIFA World Cupâ¢ Ambassador and four-time African Footballer of the Year, previews this yearâs tournament, which will get underway at Al Bayt Stadium on 20 November.You experienced the FIFA World Cupâ¢ in Europe, Africa and South America. How special will this yearâs tournament be for the Middle East and Arab world?  It will be really important and special because itâs going to be the first time that an Arab and Islamic country will host this important competition. For Qatar to be the first Muslim nation to host the World Cup is brilliant. For all players of Islamic faith, it will be more than an honour to be a part of this.How will the timing of the tournament â from 20 November to 18 December â benefit the players? The timing means the top European leagues and clubs will be taking a break from their seasons. Itâs going to be unusual in the sense that players are going to be fit and not fatigued from playing a long season with their clubs. In that way, I think itâs going to be historic. I canât wait to see how it all unfolds.The compact nature of Qatar 2022 means fans will always be near a stadium. Are you looking forward to attending more than one match a day during the early stages of the tournament?Iâm very much looking forward to that. That is the thing that has amazed me the most about this World Cup. Iâve been impressed with the way Qatar has prepared and how ready they are to host fans from around the world. Having had conversations with the organisers, the ease with which people will be able to get around is another reason why I think this World Cup will be special."
138,27 September 2022,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/qatar-2022-transformative-role-in-making-the-country-more-accessible-for-disabled%20people,"Qatarâs hosting of the FIFA World Cupâ¢ is playing a transformative role in making the country more accessible for disabled people.The Accessibility Forum â launched by the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) in 2016 â has been at the centre of planning to ensure tournament facilities and wider public infrastructure meet the requirements of the disabled community. âThe Accessibility Forum ensures that the most important stakeholders in the country, including disabled people, play a direct role in determining how the tournament can leave a legacy for generations to come. We wanted to make sure the World Cup made Qatar more accessible, while setting new standards in how to host accessible sporting events,â said Khaled Al Suwaidi, the SCâs Stakeholder Relations Director.In addition to direct engagements with the SC and tournament organisers, members of the Accessibility Forum have worked closely with organisations in the transportation, hospitality and cultural sectors to make Qatar more accessible. The result has been substantial enhancements â making it easier for people to move around the country and access key sites and services. Ikrami Ahmad, a blind member of the Accessibility Forum, spoke of the impact of hosting the tournament on disabled people in Qatar.âThere has been a marked difference across the country in recent years,â said Ahmad. âThereâs more of an interest in accessibility, regardless of the cost or return on investment. Itâs regarded as a human right â and this commitment will be felt by fans visiting Qatar for the World Cup.âAhmad said the Doha Metro helps him lead a more independent life. âThe metro system is one of the best places for blind people in Qatar. The floor indicators and audible announcements create a barrier-free journey. Knowing the delivery of the metro system was accelerated due to the World Cup is one of the many ways that the legacy of the tournament is already being felt by the disabled community in Qatar.âWheelchair athlete Ahmad Al Shahrani confirmed the progress in recent years. âWe can see greater accessibility in shopping malls, libraries, universities and hospitals. I would say that that 80% of key locations in Qatar are wheelchair accessible â something which benefits disabled people and others,â said Al Shahrani.  Ghanimeh Al Taweel believes the FIFA World Cupâ¢ is creating a fundamental shift in the way disability is seen in Qatar.âThe accessible infrastructure has led to more disabled people being seen out and about in our communities â on the streets, in work places and schools. It means greater integration and a voice at the decision-making table,â said Al Taweel, who is an accessibility researcher.In addition to accessible infrastructure, this yearâs FIFA World Cupâ¢ will introduce a range of new features for the disabled community. For the first time, blind and partially sighted fans will be able to listen to audio descriptive commentary in Arabic at World Cup matches. The service is accessible through a mobile application and will be available at all eight stadiums. Sensory rooms will also be offered at different stadiums to provide neuro-divergent fans with the ability to watch matches in a quieter space, equipped with assistive technology and managed by expert staff. The rooms will be installed by the SC and local stakeholders.âWe are aiming to deliver the most accessible version of the FIFA World Cup in history,â added Al Suwaidi. âWe are continually working with stakeholders to ensure the entire user journey is barrier-free. It is important we involve all sectors of society in our activities. We want everyone in Qatar to be a part of the first World Cup in our region.âFans interested in attending Qatar 2022 should click here for the latest tickets, accommodation and Hayya Card information."

The hotly-contested match against Kuwait had gone to penalties â but the game stopped, and silence fell across the stadium, before the big screen announced that Qatar would host the 2022 edition of the FIFA World Cupâ¢.Jubilation broke out â and in that moment both sets of fans celebrated together.âFor us, as Arabs, it was an historic moment,â said Mahmoud, who scored 57 goals in 148 international appearances. âQatar has been adamant from the very beginning that this World Cup is for all Arabs, and it is something that we all are very proud of. Before the announcement, so many of us doubted that this region would ever be given the right to host the tournament, but Qatar has enabled all of our dreams to turn into reality.âAlthough Iraq failed to qualify for this yearâs tournament, millions of Iraqis will tune in for the first FIFA World Cupâ¢ in the Middle East and Arab world. With football being wildly popular in the country of 40 million, many fans will make the short journey to Qatar to take in the tournament from the stands.âEverywhere I go in Iraq, people stop me and ask about tickets and accommodation,â said Mahmoud. âEveryone wants to be a part of this historic event. Itâs because Qatar 2022 holds tremendous significance for us. It will showcase our culture to the rest of the world. The richness of our heritage will be seen in homes across Europe, the Americas and Australia.âMahmoud, who is a FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ Ambassador, earned legendary status when he led the Lions of Mesopotamia to a famous win at the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. Winning the continental championship contributed greatly to ending civil strife in Iraq, and reaffirmed footballâs role in bringing people together.He said: âEveryone in Iraq loves football and everyone loves the World Cup in particular. Qatar has given us all the chance to be part of this tournament by hosting it in our back yard. Fans can now drive to the tournament from countries like Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia, to watch the best players fight for the most important title of them all.âMahmoud, who turned out for clubs in Iraq, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, believes Qatar 2022 will improve the level of football in the region.âThere are some big teams from the region, like Algeria, Egypt and Iraq, that didnât qualify for Qatar 2022. Every team in the region fought so hard to be in this edition of the tournament, to have the chance to play in front of their own fans, and this drive will surely build momentum for the game in the future.âHosts Qatar will be joined by Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Tunisia from the Arab world. The four countries will be supported by millions of fans who would love to see a team from the region make it to the latter stages of the tournament.âFootball is so loved by everyone in the region, and it is a source of joy for many, regardless of their background. National teams know this and know what a tournament like the World Cup means. For those countries in the region that missed out, they will now work to make it up to their fans in future tournaments. For those that did qualify, they will prepare to fly the flags of their nation and the entire Arab world proudly.âMahmoud, who enjoyed a trophy-laden five-year spell with local side Al Gharafa, believes the current generation of Qatari players have the ability to make waves in the tournament.âEveryone will be looking at the Qataris to do something in this World Cup. Their participation in the tournament comes at a great time for the team. With players like Akram Afif, Almoez Ali and Bassam Al Rawi in the line-up, anything is possible. Playing at home will be a huge advantage for them, and I am sure these players will have a big tournament.âHaving lived for many years in Qatar, Mahmoud is excited to see what tournament organisers will have in place for the many fans who travel to Doha from across the globe.âQatar wonât sleep for the entirety of the tournament. It wonât just be the football, but also the other activities that will be taking place at the same time. It will be an exceptional carnival that the entire world will not forget. Anyone lucky enough to attend will surely be making a dream come true. It will be an experience to tell their grandchildren about.âFans interested in attending Qatar 2022 should click here for the latest tickets, accommodation and Hayya Card information."

In addition, the country has implemented a host of sustainable projects which will reduce the environmental impact and provide numerous legacy benefits.â¢To mark Earth Day 2021, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) highlights the projects which will help reduce the countryâs carbon footprint and achieve its goal of staging the first carbon-neutral World Cup.  Compact tournamentAlong with hosting the first World Cup in the Middle East and Arab world, Qatar will stage the most compact edition of the tournament in modern history. Sixty-four matches over 28 days will take place in close proximity, with the maximum travel distance between stadiums just 75km. One of the major environmental benefits of Qatar 2022 is the elimination of domestic flights during the tournament.âUsing our environmentally-friendly transportation systems, such as the Doha Metro, light rail trams and fuel-efficient buses, will greatly reduce overall carbon emissions,â said Thani Al Zarraa, the SCâs Mobility Director. âAnd due to Qatar 2022 being a compact tournament, fans arriving in 2022 will only have one return plane journey, which will significantly reduce overall carbon emissions [compared to previous tournaments].ââAnd due to Qatar 2022 being a compact tournament, fans arriving in 2022 will only have one return plane journey, which will significantly reduce overall carbon emissions [compared to previous tournaments].âHamad International AirportMore than 1 million fans are expected to arrive at Hamad International Airport during the World Cup. The airport is recognised as one of the most sustainable in the region after retaining its Level 3 Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA). The ACA is the only institutionally-endorsed, global carbon management certification programme for airports worldwide. In addition, the airport recently joined a local campaign called Tarsheed which led to increasing the air conditioning temperature by 1C during the winter period â an initiative which reduced carbon emissions by approximately 1,000 tons. Run by the Qatar General Electricity & Water Corporation (KAHRAMAA), Tarsheed promotes the efficient use of water and electricity in Qatar."
