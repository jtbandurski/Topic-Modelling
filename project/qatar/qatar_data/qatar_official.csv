One month to the day since Lionel Messi, Lionel Scaloni and La Albiceleste lifted the trophy, we review some facts and figures from on and off the pitch, that reflect the sheer scale of the biggest single sporting event on the planet.Early figures suggest that around 5 billion people have engaged with the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢, following tournament content across an array of platforms and devices across the media universe. On social media, according to Nielsen, there have been 93.6 million posts across all platforms, with a 262 billion cumulative reach and 5.95 billion engagements.The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ was enjoyed inside the stadiums by 3.4 million spectators - up from 3 million in 2018 - who were treated to a historic tournament. 172 goals ensured that Qatar 2022 became the highest scoring FIFA World Cup in history, eclipsing the previous highest total of 171, in both 1998 and 2014.Three matches at Lusail Stadium, including the Final, saw the highest attendance for a match registered at a FIFA World Cup since USA 1994 when Brazil played Italy in front of 94,194 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.It was a tournament too of notable contributions from some of footballâs heavyweights. Cristiano Ronaldo became the first man to score at five FIFA World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022) while Lionel Messi became the first player to score in four successive knockout stage matches in a FIFA World Cup since the round of 16 was introduced into the modern era, at Mexico â86. Messi also passed another landmark when he made his 26th FIFA World Cup appearance in the final, overtaking the record previously held by Lothar MatthÃ¤us.The fastest goal came after just 68 seconds when Canada's Alphonso Davies, 22, scored against Croatia. At just 18 years and 110 days, Spainâs Gavi became the youngest goal scorer at a World Cup since PelÃ© in 1958, with a stunning strike during the 7-0 win against Costa Rica."

2,11 January 2023,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/sc-workers-welfare-standards-protected-more-than-200000-workers-during-qatar-2022,"As fans celebrated and cheered for their favourite players on the pitch during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) honoured and protected heroes off the pitch â hundreds of thousands of workers â all of whom played an instrumental role in the delivery and success of the tournament.The cornerstone of these efforts were Workersâ Welfare Standards (WWS), developed by the SC to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of workers. The SC continued to steer the implementation of the WWS to the wider tournament-centric sectors, to protect around 200,000 workers. The ground-breaking recruitment fees reimbursement programme, also continued to grow programme-wide. By the end of 2022, 266 contractors reimbursed QAR 86.6 M to more than 49,000 SC and non-SC workers who were charged illegal recruitment fees. In addition, three hotel operators and service providers also reimbursed QAR 163,670 to 58 workers. Following the success of the SCâs Workersâ Welfare Forums in the construction sector, these forums were extended to 70 hotels, in continued efforts to give workers a voice. These forums have empowered workers to share grievances through elected representatives, without fear of retaliation.The SC also focused on enhancing the bespoke StayQool cooling suits for workers, which were specifically designed to combat heat stress. By 2022, over 52,000 suits were deployed, in addition to 5,000 vests to security guards and 13,000 balaclavas to workers exposed to dust or sun. The StayQool suits were piloted in non-construction sectors to explore its wider use for outdoor professions.The SCâs continued progress in building the workersâ welfare legacy took centre stage at various high-profile events that were held during the year, including the panel discussions at the Concordia Annual Summit, World Innovation Summit for Health (WISH) 2022 and the UN General Assemblyâs International Migration Review Forum, as well as webinars conducted by the Centre for Sport and Human Rights (CSHR) that focused on human rights and best practices in the hospitality and security sectors.Test events held during the year, such as the FIFA World Cupâ¢ Intercontinental Play-offs, the Lusail Super Cupâ¢ and the Bollywood Music Festival, helped to inform and augment the workersâ welfare approach for the FIFA World Cup 2022â¢ and to cement tournament-readiness. As the FIFA World Cupâ¢ kicked off, WWDâs team of inspectors met and interviewed more than 8,000 workers across stadiums, training sites and non-competition venues over the course of the tournament, to ensure that workersâ rights were protected. Where issues were identified, follow-ups with contractors and government authorities were conducted to ensure that appropriate actions were taken. The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ was testament to how the SC catalysed the transformative power of sports to deliver lasting social change. This was the first FIFA World Cupâ¢ to have a dedicated workersâ welfare and labour rights team to protect workersâ rights. This was an unprecedented achievement on a FIFA World Cupâ¢ programme, which has never before seen such emphasis being placed on human rights. While the tournament has concluded, the SCâs focus on workersâ welfare continues uninterrupted. Its commitment to collaboration and knowledge transfer will ensure that the pioneering work undertaken over the past decade continues to inform and strengthen Qatarâs labour reforms to protect migrant workers.

3,5 January 2023,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/we-are-promoting-healthier-smarter-and-safer-societies,"For B4Development (B4D) â a Qatar 2022 legacy project launched by the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) â 2022 was an important year. It saw the Middle East and North Africa regionâs first behavioural insights and nudge unit partake in several activities during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢, thereby setting new standards in the way behavourial science can play a role in mega sporting events.B4D worked with different stakeholders to put in place a number of nudges â or design led prompts â to influence the behaviour of fans during the tournament. For example, B4D teamed up with the World Health Organization (WHO) and Qatarâs Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) to promote healthy food options at Qatar 2022 stadiums as well as the FIFA Fan Festivalâ¢. To achieve this, foods that were deemed as healthy options on the menu were made more attractive by highlighting them, as well as providing a picture of how they would look.B4D also supported with the design of tournament messaging to encourage greater use of public transportation, environmentally sustainable behaviors in stadiums, training of volunteers as well as applying early for the mandatory Hayya Card.The work B4D undertook throughout the year also extended beyond the FIFA World Cupâ¢. In May, B4D continued its work with the MoPH by conducting a nation-wide experiment that informed decision makers about the healthy living and eating habits of Qatarâs citizens and residents. A month later, in July, B4D participated in the Concordia Americas Summit 2022. During the global gathering, B4D discussed their work as part of the partnership between Generation Amazing and Concacaf. The initiative will see behavioural science used across 41 countries to behaviorally inform, monitoring and evaluate social policies. This will work to ensure that the legacy of Qatar 2022 impacts disenfranchised communities around the world.âThrough our partnerships in Qatar and around the world, we are promoting the use of behavioural science as a tool to build healthier, smarter and safer societies. This past year proved that nudge units like B4D have an important role to play in policymaking, and making a difference to peopleâs lives, and that is something that we will carry with us going into the future,â added Dr. Makki.Follow @roadto2022news on Twitter and Instagram to learn more about the legacy and social impact of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ on Qatar and the world."

But a series of injuries curtailed her football career at the age of just 22 â forcing her to rethink her career objectives. Carling has spent the last week in Qatar as part of the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacyâs Cultural Activation Programme during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢. She has produced murals at the Corniche and outside Al Bayt and Lusail stadiums, including during the final between Argentina and France. We caught up with Carling to discuss her work and inspiration, along with her dreams for the future. I call my work âportraits of immortalityâ. We canât play our sport forever â so I ask athletes to choose a moment when they felt invincible, when they felt like a gladiator on the pitch, and then I paint it. From 1912 to 1948, art was an Olympic sport, including poetry, sculpture and painting. It shows thereâs a close link between sport and art. When youâre on the field, youâre creating â and I try to bring that experience of playing to my artwork. Tell us about your Qatar 2022 experience.Tell us about the work youâve created in Qatar.I was asked to create pieces of footballers. I wanted to highlight iconic goals and moments. The first piece I did featured Richarlisonâs scissor-kick for Brazil against Serbia, which was one of the best goals of the tournament. The next piece I did featured Messi and Maradona at Lusail Stadium; then I painted Mbappe and Achraf Hakimi at Al Bayt. I wanted to paint Mbappe and Hakimi as they are friends â I wanted to show the respect and sportsmanship between them. I actually know Richarlison and Achraf, so I messaged them a photo of the murals I created. It was really cool. For the final, I painted Messi and Mbappe. I added the third star to the Argentina crest after they lifted the trophy. The response from fans after the match was amazing.Showcasing my work here is indescribable. My goal when I was younger was to make the World Cup as a player but that couldnât happen. Being the first sports artist to paint at a World Cup is amazing though. Itâs historic. Being among the fans and getting the feedback and interaction is awesome. Having everyone appreciate my art on a global scale is life-changing and so rewarding. Iâm really grateful for this opportunity.  Whatâs next for your career?"

You need to describe the distances on the pitch, the playersâ facial expressions, the number of people in a wall, what type of corner is taken. Itâs about trying to paint a picture in peopleâs minds by following the ball and providing as much detail as possible.â"

I produce techno, which can be both dark and energetic. The music reflects who I am as a person and my energy â both as Khalid and when I step on stage as DJ Deus Deserto.How and when did you start performing?I began to DJ in college, which was 2014. Since high school, it was my dream to own some decks and learn how to do it. So, before I started college, I worked for six months to save up and buy my own kit. I was ecstatic when I bought them and did a lot of experimenting. In fact, I only started doing this professionally about three years ago â thatâs when I started producing music. Then, in 2021, I released my first track.Music is my part-time job for now. I am proud to say that Iâve been successful in releasing my music with international labels and have been fortunate to land gigs in Qatar and the United States. I plan to push further and see where my art can take me.How has your World Cup experience been so far?Itâs been amazing, I am really impressed with the organisation and entertainment. The football itself has also been incredible to watch this year. The crowds are super supportive when Iâm performing. For me, the cultural performances have been the most fun to see. It helps that we are working with such energetic fans. I was also lucky to be able to perform in front of a huge crowd at MDL Beast here in Qatar and showcase my music to a diverse audience. It was an amazing experience and the production level was mind-blowing. Next, Iâll be taking my music to the spider stage at Arcadia. "

It is the first edition of the tournament to be held in the Middle East and Arab world, the first compact tournament in modern history and the first to have an official soundtrack.It is also the first FIFA World Cupâ¢ to have a digital mascot. Laâeeb â an Arabic word meaning super-skilled player â was unveiled to the world during the final draw in April. Laâeeb hails from the âmascot-verseâ â a world where all previous tournament mascots live â and is known for his youthful spirit; spreading joy and confidence wherever he goes. Laâeeb, who is adventurous, fun and curious, has attended every previous FIFA World Cup tournament and contributed to some of the most famous moments in football history.Here, we speak to Ahmed Al Baker, Fahad Al Kuwari and Mohammed Al Ibrahim, who worked on Laâeebâs launch video, to find out more about the challenge of creating content that appeals to football fans across the globe. The visionQataris Al Baker, Al Kuwari and Al Ibrahim were excited to develop the launch video for the mascot when they received the initial concept about his character.âIt was very exciting to be involved in this project and our objective was to deliver something different to every previous mascot launch,â said Al Baker, who has been working as a director and producer for 12 years. âOne of our main aims was to present him in a humourous and interactive way while ensuring he appeals to as many people as possible â not just football fans.âAl Kuwari added: âI am not a huge football lover and during the animation process, I looked at Laâeeb from an outsiderâs point of view. Part of the challenge was creating content that non-football fans would enjoy â and I think Laâeeb ended up being liked by everyone due to his uplifting personality.âWriter and director Al Ibrahim worked as a senior content developer on the animation. He said: âI helped to build on his backstory â not only his origins but information about his home, the mascot-verse. We had to think about his personality traits and motivations â it was a really interesting project.âThe creative team also wanted Laâeeb to resonate with people long after the tournament â which will conclude with the final at Lusail Stadium on 18 December. âItâs very important to us that Laâeeb stays in the minds of football fans after the World Cup,â said Al Kuwari, a graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar. âThis is one of the reasons we built the mascot-verse, which allows Laâeeb to visit mascots from previous tournaments.âA mascot with a voiceLaâeebâs uniqueness extends to his voice.âWhen we presented our work, FIFA really liked the scripts we had developed for Laâeeb,â said Al Kuwari, who holds a Masterâs in film and screen studies from Goldsmiths, University of London.The next challenge was deciding Laâeebâs accent and ensuring he would resonate with people in Qatar, the region and beyond.âAt first, we wanted Laâeeb to speak Arabic with a Qatari accent â however we also wanted him to reach international audiences. In the end, we opted for English â but spoken by a local person â to show Laâeeb is Qatari and can connect with people anywhere,â said Al Baker.Al Kuwari added: âAs content creators, it is our responsibility to create narratives true to our culture and heritage, and present them to international audiences.âNew technologyLaâeebâs virtual nature meant the creative options were endless and opened the door to utilise the latest digital technology. âFrom holograms, digital screens and new media, there was plenty of room for creativity and we were able to experiment with different technologies,â said Al Baker. Al Kuwari added: âOur priority was for Laâeeb to entertain fans. We wanted to create uplifting and interactive content, so we approached this in the same way we look at cinematic scripts. Getting to know Laâeeb is a journey everyone will go through during the tournament. The audience learned about his skills and personality during the draw â and there will be plenty more to find out during the World Cup.âThe power of storytellingFor Al Ibrahim, seeing his creation come to life on a scale of such magnitude represents a dream-turned-reality.He said: âSeeing Laâeeb everywhere is testament to the power of storytelling. He is a character that will be remembered by future generations and exposed to billions of people during the World Cup.âThis is something every content creator dreams of â and knowing Iâve contributed is something Iâll always be proud of.âFans interested in attending Qatar 2022 should click here for the latest tickets, accommodation and Hayya Card information."

A year later, we started working on parkour and established the Prodigal UPG in 2006, coining the phrase âperformance parkourâ to describe the art.Malik Diouf, the co-creator of parkour, happened to meet us when he filmed one of our original performances for his documentary and subsequently joined the team, which has been incredible. Although heâs very busy being a stunt performer and training new talent, he still works closely with us.We have performed all over the world and teach the art globally, so itâs been quite a journey so far, with ambitious plans for the future.

The fans are out in force, everyone is in good spirits and the atmosphere is uplifting. You see people from all over the world striking up conversations and friendships. We see people staying until the end of our performances â they want to have a chat, take selfies and learn more about our act. Even when we travel on the metro at the end of the night, people of all nationalities talk to us and we often see people return to watch our performances multiple times, which is a great compliment for us. As positive word-of-mouth spreads, we are seeing more people coming to watch us daily.A sports tournament reinforces the important message that human beings from across the world have much in common. Our act is visual and silent and I think that adds to its universal appeal. Weâre delighted it brings everyone together, while also highlighting key messages. For example, one of our pieces reflects the rise and prominence of womenâs football. Weâve noticed a natural spirit and friendliness of people here. It is pleasant, safe, jovial and respectful. Opposing fans are having sing-offs in the street and it is all done in good jest. The banter and camaraderie have been fun to see. What are your overall impressions of Qatar?We first performed here back in 2014 when we collaborated with the British Council. We were also fortunate to do performances in Kuwait and Oman at that time.We found Qatar charming back in 2014 â but seeing it now, in 2022, and the scale at which it has developed, is mind-blowing. The skyline is almost unrecognisable, the metro is incredible and the overall infrastructure is very impressive. During our first visit, we performed at Souq Waqif but this time we couldnât quite work out where we had performed until we noticed a shoe shop. As we looked around, we realised just how much everything had evolved since our last visit.Which team are you supporting during the World Cup?Well, our team is always very united, however we do have a variety of answers to this question! One person is supporting Ghana, while another cheers for Iran. We also have someone backing Saudi Arabia, and another supporting England. Then thereâs a couple of us who always cheer for the underdogs.You can catch Prodigal UPGâs performances next to the UK pavilion at the Museum of Islamic Art Park daily at 4:30 PM, 6 PM, 7 PM and 8 PM.Fans interested in attending Qatar 2022 should click here for the latest tickets, accommodation and Hayya Card information.

Then thereâs me, the youngest in the family. Iâm the youngest female football coach in Qatar with Al Arabi womenâs team.âAfnanâs football journey began with her father, during his coaching days.âGrowing up, I remember going with my dad to Al Markhiya Sports Club when he was the coach. I was too young to understand the game or what was going on â but I used to sit on the benches and try to understand the sport,â said Afnan.âIn time, I learned more about football at school. I remember seeing my brothers come home with medals and trophies and I used to ask what theyâre for. I slowly began to understand football and what was going on. My brother Afif taught me about the game and Ali and Akram supported me all the way until I fell in love with it and became a coach.âAfnan is also incredibly proud that Qatar is hosting the first FIFA World Cup in the Middle East and Arab world.She said: âAs a Qatari, I am beyond proud of this milestone. This will go down in the history books â the fact that an Arab country persevered and was able to host the biggest sporting event so seamlessly and successfully is a huge achievement.âFans interested in attending Qatar 2022 should click here for the latest tickets, accommodation and Hayya Card information."

73,14 November 2022,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/understanding-the-legacy-has-helped-me-tell-the-story-of-qatars-world-cup,"With the FIFA World Cupâ¢ only days away, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, in close collaboration with FIFA, is wrapping up preparations for the tournament and the legacy it will deliver.â¢In this new series, Making History, we are focusing on the work of Qatari employees who have played a key role in the SCâs journey.Our interview today is with Fatma Al Nuaimi, Executive Director, Communications & Media, who joined the SC from ICT Qatar in 2012.Tell us about your background and growing up in Qatar.I come from a football family. My dad â Ali Al Nuaimi â was an ambassador and a big football fan. My uncle was one of the founding members of Qatar Sports Club. The moment people see my name, they automatically know Iâm a Qatar Sports Club fan. Where did you go to university and what were your aspirations growing up?I studied English language and literature at Qatar University. I also did my Masters there. Growing up, I was inspired by my dad, so international relations and languages interested me. However, technology was my main interest. Itâs everywhere and you can see how itâs improving peopleâs lives.One event that inspired me when I was younger was the Asian Games in Doha. I attended the opening and followed all the news about it. I was too young to be part of the workforce but I wished I was involved. I felt it was a missed opportunity â I wish I had volunteered or done something to support it. However, it inspired me to volunteer for future sporting events. I met people through volunteering at sporting events who I now work with at the SC. Like everyone, I never thought the World Cup would be hosted here â so it feels like we have been given a golden opportunity to work on something even bigger than the Asian Games.Tell us about your career. I started my career with ICT Qatar in 2007. At the time, Qatar was booming and a lot of entities were being established as the country was looking to move away from oil and gas. I started with the information security team, specifically communications and outreach. At this time, technology was being adapted for different sectors, like health and education. Our work helped to open up the market and establish a whole new ecosystem. Later I worked in the ICT and society department.One person who inspired me was Her Excellency Hessa Al Jaber, the former Minister for Information Communications & Technology. She made sure we â as fresh graduates â were involved in everything. If there was a board meeting or strategy session, she would have young people there to see how decisions are made. She wanted us to understand every part of the business. She helped us all to understand the bigger picture.  Where were you when Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup and how did you feel?We had a family gathering and were all watching TV. I cried after the announcement. I had feelings of pride and happiness. I was also thinking of my dad, who had passed away earlier that year. I wished I could tell my dad we had won the bid.Winning was a dream. I knew it was something big. Even if we didnât win, the fact we put ourselves out there, it was still an achievement. But winning was amazing. It was unimaginable for so many people. How keen were you to be involved in the delivery of the tournament?Very keen. I remember at that time, Qatar was also bidding to host the 2020 Olympics and there was a competition run by the bid committee to design a website for Doha 2020. You had to come up with ideas, functionality, innovation. My friend and I partnered up and we managed to win. There were more than 2,000 applications from across the region and the final was at Katara, with Sheikha Al Mayassa on the jury. That gave us both a bit of profile. We won QAR 100,000 and got to engage with the bid team. Qatar didnât win the bid in the end but that experience was so valuable. After we won, a colleague at the SC called me and asked me to come for an interview for the Legacy department. Tell us about your career with the SC.I was involved in social and human legacy projects when I joined. I worked on the Josoor Institute project and was involved in setting it up. I helped to develop the Challenge 22 innovation competition â which was similar to the competition I won with my friend. There, I had been on the receiver side, so I knew how we could work with businesses to build the project. I was also involved in strategy before moving to Communications. Now, I have a much wider scope: digital, content, media relations, community engagement, ambassadors and much more. Working in legacy â from the stage where our ideas were only on paper â has helped me a lot in my current role. Knowing the strategy makes the projects easier to communicate about. Thatâs been the great bridge between my roles at the SC. What are your favourite memories of your time at the SC?There are so many â itâs hard to pick one. A few days ago, we had a meeting with the whole team and it was wonderful to see everyone all ready for the tournament. When I look back over the last 10 years, no matter how beautiful our stadiums are or the other facilities, it all comes down to people. And seeing everyone there â like-minded and with the same spirit â I could see we are heading in the right direction. It was a proud moment and emotional because it is the final chapter. I could see everyone is unified. Everyone at the SC is like a second family to me. I always try to have close connections to my team. How will you feel when the opening match kicks off at Al Bayt Stadium?I will feel itâs real â and at that moment Iâll try and catch my breath. Right now, weâre just waiting for the fans to come and enjoy themselves. Everything is ready â and when the tournament finally kicks off, I will be emotional. Iâm sure I will be proud too.And what about the final at Lusail Stadium â how will you feel when the trophy is lifted on 18 December?Iâll be filled with pride but at the same time I wonât be able to believe itâs the end. Weâve been working on the same project for the last 10 years and there will be mixed emotions. Delivering a World Cup is not a normal business. Itâs 24/7, itâs demanding, thereâs pressure. Iâm not sure how Iâll go back to a quiet life.Whatâs next for you â in 2023 and beyond?I think Iâll have a holiday first and then focus on telling the story of Qatar 2022. As a communications team, we will have a lot of work to do. We need to look at the sustainability of the event, the economic impact and narrate the story of how the World Cup will boost Qatar long into the future. There will still be plenty of work for us to do next year. For me, I love to be involved in transformational projects. Qatar has changed so much in recent years. So many things have opened. People will see the fan experience and entertainment options during the World Cup, and these things will continue to enhance the community and quality of life in Qatar. Itâs crucial we keep working hard to develop our country. "

Among the first players to touchdown in Doha were representatives from the United States of America, with several members of Gregg Berhalterâs Group B aspirants arriving at Hamad International Airport on Thursday evening.

Like several national team managers, Berhalter announced his squad for the forthcoming FIFA World Cup this week, naming 26 players on his roster to challenge England, Wales, and Iran throughout the group phase.

The USA â a co-host of the FIFA World Cup in 2026 â will feature at their 11th FIFA World Cup in 2022, with their best result in the tournament coming in the inaugural edition in Uruguay in 1930 when they finished third.

Jesus Ferreira, Sean Johnson, Aaron Long, Jordan Morris, Walker Zimmerman, Kellyn Acosta, DeAndre Yedlin, Cristian Roldan and Shaq Moore were among the first batch of FIFA World Cup stars to set foot in Qatar, and they will be joined by hundreds more over the coming days, as the 32 participating nations get set to pursue world footballâs greatest prize.

Berhalter cannot wait for USAâs FIFA World Cup quest to commence.

âWe believe we have a talented group, a strong team spirit, and one that is ready to compete. We are extremely proud and honoured to represent the United States and appreciate all the amazing support from our fans in Qatar,â he said."

80,10 November 2022,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/qatars-revolutionary-stadium-cooling-technology,"With innovation and sustainability at the heart of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ preparations, cooling technology is one of the tournamentâs major success stories. The revolutionary system was first showcased during the inauguration of Khalifa International Stadium in 2017 and since then has been adapted to benefit six more tournament venues, as well as other facilities across the country.With Qatarâs World Cup taking place in November and December, the pressure on cooling systems will be limited, with outside temperatures estimated to be 18-24Â°C. The technology will, however, allow sporting events to be held all-year-round, in addition to other activities, like shopping and farming.Energy-efficient cooling systems were developed following Qatarâs successful bid for the World Cup, with the technology delivered by the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy in collaboration with Qatar University (QU). Dr. Saud Abdulaziz Abdul Ghani, Professor of Engineering at QU, played a key role in the cooling journey, which started with his university studies decades earlier.âMy PhD study focused on air conditioning in a car and we applied the same theory to our World Cup stadiums â but obviously on a much bigger scale,â said Dr. Saud.The technology is now fitted in seven of eight Qatar 2022 stadiums, with the only exception Stadium 974, which is fully-demountable and features natural ventilation. Each of the other venueâs cooling technology is different and made to fit its unique design and features. Using solar-powered energy, outside air is cooled and then distributed through grills in the stands and large pitch-side nozzles. The systems use insulation and spot cooling to make them as environmentally-friendly as possible.âSpot cooling means we only cool the areas where people need it â like on the pitch and in the stands,â said Dr. Saud. âThe form of each stadium acts as a barrier, which contains a cold bubble inside. Our air circulation technique cools the air, filters it and pushes it out towards the players and fans. Each stadium is cooled to a comfortable temperature of around 20 degrees, with spot cooling enhancing our commitment to sustainability and the environment.â "

85,7 November 2022,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/the-world-cup-has-transformed-qatar-im-proud-to-be-a-part-of-it,"With only weeks to go until Qatar hosts the first FIFA World Cupâ¢ in the Middle East and Arab world, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), in close collaboration with FIFA, is wrapping up preparations for the tournament and the legacy it will deliver.In this new series, we are focusing on the work of Qatari employees who have played a key role in the SCâs journey. This week, we speak to Thani Al Zarraa, who joined the SC in 2012 and has worked on a range of projects over the last decade, including stadium developments, legacy programmes and transport management. What were you doing when Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup?I fondly remember it. It was 2 December 2010. At that time, I was a graduate student impatiently waiting for graduation day in Australia. My friends and colleagues from Gulf countries got together to watch the announcement. We were all wearing bid T-shirts to show our support. Australia was also part of the bid, so when we heard the news, we were ecstatic! We went out into the streets to celebrate. Were you a football fan growing up?Tell us about your journey working at the SC.Back in 2012, we only had plans on paper and feasibility studies, which werenât even complete. Back then, I was with the legacy department and we used to create legacy benefit case studies to explore the potential use of World Cup venues after the tournament. We used to conduct focus groups with local communities to ask them how they could benefit from World Cup facilities and to find out any concerns they had. Later, I moved into construction and eventually became Al Janoub Stadium Project Director.How has working at the SC impacted your career?Itâs been incredibly valuable. Iâve had the opportunity to take part in international events on secondment and observation programmes. These offered great insight into venue management and how mega-events are organised. I attended the UEFA Champions League final in 2017 between Juventus and Real Madrid and was with the project team in charge of dressing and signage, making sure all the overlay was ready. During the 2019 Copa America, I was an assistant venue manager in Rio. We were responsible for the Estadio do MaracanÃ£, two team hotels and two training sites. I am so grateful for all these experiences and much more over the last 10 years. They have given me the ability so build technical expertise and reach my current role working in transport. Tell us about your current role and how it is supporting the tournament.I work in transport management. I believe that transport, after the venues, is the main artery of any mega-event. As part of my role, I ensure that different transportation projects in the country are being delivered to a high standard â as part of our bid commitments to FIFA. We are making sure the different transport options, whether bus, metro, tram or taxi, work efficiently for our different constituent groups, including fans and players. We consider the whole experience â from the moment people arrive at the airport to the moment they depart. We work closely with a range of stakeholders to make sure our plans are streamlined and communicated effectively. Another key aspect of our operations during the tournament will be the command centre, where we will gather all transport elements under one umbrella and review their operations continuously during the tournament. What do you hope fans experience, in terms of transportation services, during the World Cup?I think the compact nature of the tournament is a huge advantage â but we are encouraging all fans and visitors to plan their journeys carefully. I think fans will be amazed how close everything is â from their accommodation to stadiums to fan zones. We have worked very hard to cater for everyone and ensure their journeys are as smooth as possible. What does your typical day at the SC look like? My favourite part of the day is early morning. I get up at 4:30 AM to exercise. Then I come to the office and itâs usually very quiet, as you would expect at that time. I have a coffee and plan my agenda for the day. Iâm usually in meetings or on calls throughout. There are always new challenges. No day is the same. What mark do you hope to leave in your experience working for the SC?Well, I think it works both ways, because Qatar has given us many opportunities. We are very lucky to be given the resources and facilities and then be given the chance to contribute to the success of the tournament and the country overall. Which moment from your career at the SC is the most memorable?I was part of the inauguration of Khalifa International Stadium in 2017. Al Janoub Stadium was another big milestone for me. I was part of the venue management team at the inauguration and the project team during construction. Both stadiums are very close to my heart. I can actually spot both of them on a clear day from my office window. These two moments, in May 2017 and May 2019, are very precious to me.What will you cherish most from this experience?Many things! The people that work here and the speed at which Qatar has delivered everything are admirable. The World Cup really has transformed our nation and placed it on the global stage. I am honoured to be part of this story. Who influenced you during your time at the SC?The late Hilal Al Kuwari is a personality I will never forget. I remember meeting Engineer Hilal before I worked at the SC when I wanted to conduct a feasibility study for my degree. I bumped into a consultant who was working on a major project for Qatar and they advised me to consult the project manager, who, at that time, was Engineer Hilal. Then I met him officially at the SC, when I worked with him in 2014. His energy and love for knowledge were incomparable and very infectious. He was keen on giving us the right knowledge and tools to succeed. I recall every time my colleagues and I would sit with him, we would want to make sure we were prepared with questions. He had a bulk of knowledge and eagerness to share it. He is definitely someone that I learned from. It was a great pleasure getting to know him. Whatâs on the horizon for you after the World Cup?Career-wise, I would love to keep working in the sports industry. Sport management is something I have become very passionate about, whether through my role with the SC or my hobby with the cycling federation. "

87,6 November 2022,https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/qatar-2022-organisers-aim-to-deliver-a-zero-waste-to-landfill-tournament,"With the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ fast approaching, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) is aiming to deliver a zero waste to landfill event. The overarching goal is to ensure all the waste generated at stadiums and fan zones is recycled, composted or converted to green energy.âWith the responsibility of hosting the FIFA World Cup came an even larger responsibility to avoid leaving an impact on Qatarâs environment. We started early in our journey to try to minimise the amount of waste being sent to landfill,â said Eng. Bodour Al Meer, the SCâs Sustainability Executive Director.âDuring the design and construction of our stadiums, significant focus was placed on minimising and recycling construction waste. During the operations of our stadiums, the focus is now on avoidance, minimisation, segregation, recycling and recovery,â added Al Meer.Work to deliver this achievement forms a critical part of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022â¢ Sustainability Strategy. Extensive testing took place during the FIFA Arab Cup 2021â¢. Waste generated from the 19-day tournament was segregated into organic, plastic, metal, electronic and cardboard. Remaining waste was sent to the Ministry of Municipalityâs Domestic Solid Waste Management Centre for further treatment in a waste-to-energy plant. During the tournament, each stadium recycled at least 42% of the waste generated, with the remainder converted to green energy. Al Bayt Stadium recycled more than 70% of the waste generated during the tournament.âOur work in the Arab Cup proved we can deliver a large-scale event without sending waste to landfill. Our goal is to replicate this success during the World Cup and set a new standard in hosting sustainable mega sporting events,â said Al Meer.âWhile we will continue to do our best, waste is everyoneâs responsibility. Therefore, we encourage fans to support our efforts by putting their waste in the correct bin,â added Al Meer.âWhile we will continue to do our best, waste is everyoneâs responsibility.

Hiking gives me a sense of freedom and I wanted to share this passion and love with the millions of fans that are eagerly awaiting the first World Cup in the region,â added Al Salmi, a passionate Green Falcons fan.âI hope that our national team hears of my walk, and that inspires them to do their best in the tournament. I want to show everyone that nothing is impossible, and that with hard work and determination, you can do anything,â added Al Salmi.After arriving at the Doha Corniche, Al Salmi was greeted by throngs of supporters from across Qatar. Fans congratulated him on his tremendous feat, while posing for photographs with him under the Saudi flag.âThe amazing reception Iâve received has been tremendous. As soon as I crossed the Qatari border, people met me with flowers and food. This World Cup has also been about bringing people together and I hope my journey inspires others to walk towards each other â to cross boundaries, to get to know each other, and break the stereotypes that so many of us in this region have to contend with,â said Al Salmi."

La Celeste were the first winners of the tournament â and made it a double by also claiming victory in 1950.Qatar 2022 will be Uruguayâs fourth straight appearance at footballâs showpiece event â and one man looking forward to the first FIFA World Cupâ¢ in the Middle East and Arab world is 49-year-old Pablo Sanz-Reherman, who has spent more than 18 months working as an engineer with Qatargas.What are the best places to visit in Qatar?The desert is completely unique. You can organise great tours and do so many fun things. There are also many things to do in Doha â amazing places like Souq Waqif and Msheireb. I also love the beaches here. Uruguayans love going to the beach, so Iâm sure they will enjoy Qatar.Itâs important to learn about the culture â it is obviously different here to many other countries. My advice to people is to plan everything in advance and do some research. I think itâs important to embrace the culture and respect local people. Always try to be flexible, as this will help you enjoy your experience here.Many fans have asked me questions about the tournament. Most ask about accommodation and the best places to stay. The good thing is this tournament is very compact â you will never be far from a hotel, stadium or fan zone during this World Cup.They will bring their traditions and energy. Uruguayans will want to show they are proud. We will be very visible â it will seem like there are many thousands of us! It means a lot to Uruguayans to be part of the World Cup."
